### Summary
"To be effective and successful, teacher professional development must be of high quality and relevant to teachers’ needs. No amount of ICT can compensate for TPD that lacks these characteristics." (15)

"TPD is the tool by which policymakers convey broad visions, disseminate critical information, and provide guidance to teachers." (15)

* **range of techniques to promote learning**: support, engages school leadership, evaluation, mentoring, teamwork, observation, reflection, assessment
* understanding teachers' needs and working environment
* **področja TPD**: technical skills, concerns about logistics, about how to use computers with students, risk to their status in their classroom, technical skills, work in teams (15)

TPD can be divided into three broad categories:

* standardized TPD (centralized)
* site-based TPD (in school/region)
* self-directed TPD (independent) (15-16)

### Understanding professional development

"Tought the recipient of the TPD is the teachers, the ultimate intended beneficiary is the sutdent. Consequently, professional development is often the most critical component of any ICT project." (16)

#### Professional Development vs. Training

PD - much more than training; accommodates teachers as learnersm recognizes the long-term nature of learning, an utilizes methods that are likely to lead teachers to improve their practice as professionals.

Forms of TPD:

* when teachers plan their activities together
* macher teacher observing young teacher + feedback
* discussing the lesson (16)

#### Making TPD Effective

* address teacher and student needs
* be long-term, ongoing, sequenced, commulative (16)
* focus on student learning outcome
* model learner-centred instruction
* fomrative and summative evaluation for program improvement

### Building teachers' computer skills

Computers raise many concerns among teachers, including:

* Technical concerns (“How do I use the computer?”)
* Functional concerns (“What can computers help me do?”)
* Logistical concerns (“How can I use so few computers with so many students?”)
* Affective concerns (“Will these computers replace me as a teacher? Will my students lose respect if they think the computer knows more than me?”)
* Organizational concerns (“How do I organize my classroom to support the use of computers? How can they be used as part of what I already do in the classroom?”)
* Conceptual concerns (“How can I learn from and with computers?”)
* Instructional concerns (“How can computers help my students learn in diﬀ erent ways? How 
can they support the curriculum? How can they support my teaching? How should I teach 
using computers?”)
* Evaluation concerns (“How do I assess student learning in computer-based projects? How does 
this new way of learning ﬁ t with national exams?”)

#### Successful approachers to computers in TPD

* timely: when they have computers, not before or after
* job-related (responsibilities, skills, knowledge, outcomes)
* welcoming
* hands-on (by doing)
* technically appropriate (17)

#### Learner-centred TPD

TPD should be learner-centred, enabling teachers to experience the types of instruction that they are asked to provide to their students. Activities model instructional approaches that teachers can apply in their own settings.

Teachers should engage interactively and collaboratively in activities that reflect their curricula. Teacher learn by doing - by collaborating with peers, reflecting, palnning classroom activities - not by sitting and listening to a facilitator or following along in directed technology instruction. (18)

#### Technology integration

* use of computers and the internet to support teching and learning across the curriculum
* working with computer productivity tools to complete science projects or searchin the internet to find poetry (always tided directly to student mastery of the school subjects)
* properly implemeted, technology integration is the best means of building computer skills: research in south african and egiptian schools indicates that students learn computer skills better when computers are used to address their own interest rahter than in formal skills training
* computer integration is: using computers on a regular basis, for a purpose connected to math, science, social studies or language arts. Computer use becomes a means of learning, and learning takes place through computer use. (18)

#### Standardized TPD

Focus on the exploration of an idea and the demonstration and modeling of skills.

#### Site-based TPD

Often focuses on the specific, situational problems that individual teachers encounter as they try to implement nwe techniques.

</figure>

"In self-directed TPD, teachers are asked to determine their own professional development goals and select activities that will help them attain these goals. Self-directed TPD can involve watching video examples of classrooms, reading books on education or a ﬁ eld of study, keeping journals, performing case studies, taking online courses, or observing classes taught by colleagues. Many teachers already participate in informal, self- directed TPD, by seeking out an experienced colleague for advice, for example, or searching for lesson plans on the Internet.

Self-directed TPD places all responsibility on the teacher and requires little of the school. In many cases, school leadership directs a teacher to develop expertise in a certain area without providing resources or guidance. Teachers may be challenged to make use of the resources that they ﬁnd on their own."

" Self-directed activities are most eﬀ ective with teachers who are motivated self-starters, and who have already developed teaching skills and subject mastery.

For these reasons, self-directed TPD does little to promote basic or intermediate skills, and so is of less beneﬁ t to low-skilled teachers. Computers and the Internet can make self-directed TPD more worthwhile, but even with ample access and connectivity, self-directed TPD works best with advanced teachers wishing to enhance their knowledge and skills.

While teachers should certainly be encouraged to participate in ongoing, self-motivated learning, self- directed activities should not be used as the primary means of providing TPD. Instead, they should be used to complement and extend standardized and/or site-based TPD." (23)

### Web resources to look at (about TPD)

* **International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE)**: Educational Technology Standards Th e International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) has created the most comprehensive set of ICT standards for teachers, students, and administrators. Th e standards are the product of collaboration of more than 2,000 educators who wrote, tested, and revised learning activities and multidisciplinary units to support classroom teachers preparing students to become technology-capable learners. Th e hands-on activities focus on subject matter and show how appropriate technology can be employed as part of the learning experience. [http://www.iste.org](http://www.iste.org) (select “NETS” to go the standards section) 
* **National Staﬀ  Development Council Standards for Professional Development**: The National Staff  Development Council’s Standards for Professional Development reﬂ ect the most current best practices in professional learning. Th e standards examine what students are expected to know and be able to do, what teachers must do in order to ensure student success, and the ways in which professional development must meet both goals.

* **South African Curriculum** (Wiki Book): This is an example of a Wiki—a Website that allows users to update and edit content collaboratively— that contains South Africa’s national curriculum. All information may be accessed for free, commented upon, and modiﬁ ed as necessary. [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/South_African_Curriculum](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/South_African_Curriculum)

## [ICTs and Teacher Competencies (Unesco)](http://iite.unesco.org/pics/publications/en/files/3214696.pdf)

*IITE policy brief, october 2011*

### Urgency for action

"Technology is a critical component of education in the 21st century; today’s students live in a global world and need to compete intellectually with peers worldwide. Data suggest that digital tools and strong pedagogy may help schools employ the best strategies for student achievement of both traditional and 21st-century skills. The goal of information and communication technology (ICT) initiatives in schools is not simply to use ICTs more effectively in teaching; rather, the goal is to impact and improve economic development at many levels through the use of ICTs. Learners around the world are comfortable using technology for daily connecting, creating, and sharing. The students in our classrooms today are the first to have grown up with digital tools at their fingertips; using those tools, students interact with information, create knowledge, and communicate their results to a real audience. Digital tools are always “on”, accessible anywhere there is Internet access, and many are collaborative. Learners have an expectation that their education will include the same authentic, relevant, and interactive characteristics. However, despite the great potential of technology as a catalyst for transformative change in education, it has yet to be widely implemented." (1)

"Today, new conditions exist that make it possible for technology to impact education for all. Technology is more readily available everywhere; even inexpensive mobile phones are capable of interacting with the world in ways previously unimagined. Our students are interconnected and ready; it is our teachers who require support for understanding when and how to use ICTs in teaching and learning in order to engage with and enrich students’ experiences. Education change, however, is a complicated process; it rarely happens by itself, and all components of this system (access, teachers, administrators, learners, ICTs) are essential but still not sufficient to have the impact that is required for larger systemic change." (2)

"Multiple organizations have identified goals for classroom deployment of ICTs and frameworks and standards for educators in the use of these tools. Now several factors are interacting so that it is even more imperative that educators have the ICT skills identified by UNESCO and the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE). These factors include a growing need for instruction in new skills (information, technological, and visual literacies), awareness that students have changed but educational practices have not, and an awareness of the needs around the world for students who can contribute to the work force and economic system. 

The existence of ICT frameworks and standards for teachers is not enough to facilitate the change needed. The preparation and continuing professional development of educators is a major element that is required for school transformation and appropriate use of ICTs. The literature is clear that among other factors, high-quality professional development for teachers is critical, yet often lacking in education reform efforts. This lack of effective professional development for teachers is often considered a root cause of the divide between what learners could potentially achieve and the reality they actually face in classrooms throughout the world." (2)

### The big picture of effective change

"Fullan (2011) warns that technology alone will not be an effective driver of whole system 
reform; we also need the policy and strategy levers that have the best chance of having an 
effect on student learning. Clearly, a key driver for successful reform is capacity-building 
of educators through professional development. There is growing evidence, however, that 
while technology can be a powerful partner to change, it is not a primary driver. Fullan 
asserts, “There is no evidence that technology is a particularly good entry point for whole 
system reform, but it will be a dramatic accelerator if we can put instruction, and skilled 
motivated teachers and students in the lead” (p. 6)." (3)

"To enable reform, policies must be in place to help provide and sustain a number of essential conditions. ISTE has delineated a comprehensive set of Necessary Conditions to Effectively Leverage Technology for Learning that includes: shared vision, empowered leaders, implementation planning, consistent and adequate funding, equitable access, skilled personnel, ongoing professional development, technical support, curriculum framework, student-centered learning, assessment and evaluation, engaged communities, support policies, and supportive external context (http://www.iste.org/standards/nets- for-students/nets-for-students-essential-conditions.aspx)."

"Teachers will adopt new approaches that are proven to effect student learning. Further, relative advantage will be most apparent to teachers when ICT integration is aligned with current curriculum and assessments. This, in turn, would inform and support the dissemination and adoption of ICT standards." (3)

### Standards: an important piece of the puzzle

"In recent years, several individual nations (United States, United Kingdom, France, Italy, China, and India) and UNESCO have created and supported large projects designed to define an appropriate framework for ICT use by teachers. ISTE produced the first set of standards in 2000, revising these standards in 2008. The UNESCO ICT-Competency Framework for Teachers (ICT-CFT) was developed in 2008 through collaboration among Microsoft, Intel, Cisco, ISTE, and the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech). The creation of this framework marked the first international effort in this area. The contributions of both ISTE and the UNESCO recognize the complexity of change in educational programmes, and the framework and standards combine ICT skills with emergent views in pedagogy, curriculum, and school organization. The overall goal of the UNESCO project is to improve teacher practice in a way that contributes to a better- informed citizenry and higher quality workforce that will ultimately impact a country’s economic and social development.

The UNESCO Framework acknowledges that different countries are in very different places with respect to ICT skill development for teachers, and although all countries must focus on teacher education in ICTs, countries will begin their work at different levels, defined as technology literacy, technology knowledge deepening, and knowledge creation. More specifically, the objectives of the UNESCO ICT-CFT project are to: 

* constitute a common core syllabus (defining various ICT competency skills for teachers) that professional development providers can use to develop learning materials sharable at a global level; 
* provide a basic set of qualifications that allows teachers to integrate ICTs into their teaching; 
* extend professional development of teachers, advancing their skills in pedagogy, collaboration, and school innovation using ICTs; 
* harmonize different views and vocabulary regarding the uses of ICTs in teacher education. 

The UNESCO ICT-CFT clearly recognizes that ICT education must go beyond learning about technology, and must be adapted to the curriculum, culture, and climate of different schools, districts, and nations. The UNESCO Framework also advocates for embedding ICT work in larger efforts to transform content and curriculum. While the UNESCO ICT- CFT project specifies the competencies needed to effectively use technology to support educational change, it is up to approved governmental, non-governmental, and private providers to design and deliver training for these competencies. 

The next step in implementing the UNESCO Framework must be the establishment of international, national, and local policies that make the framework a reality on the ground. It is urgent that educators and policy makers understand the myriad ways in which successful 21st-century schools operate and simultaneously realize what it will take to prepare educators for such schools. The carefully developed framework and standards that now exist mark the first step in a very important process. A large part of each national or local implementation effort must involve high-quality ICT professional development for teachers." (4)

### Professional development

Factors associated with successful profesional development (Garet et al., 2001):

* longer duration
* collective participation
* active learning opportunities
* conent focus is more effective than generic teaching strategies not tied to particular content areas
* coherence is degree to which the activity is tied to school goals, policies, standards, etc. The greater the coherence for teachers, the more effective the PD (5)

#### Examples of policies leading to effective PD

* **USA**: " In the Lake Washington School District in Redmond, Washington, educators are expected to accomplish proficiency in one ICT skill each year. One district selects a technology focus each year; educators are offered multiple ways to learn the skill and to demonstrate their knowledge. Educators who complete the process satisfactorily earn a bonus."
* **Denmark**: " All staff will use ICTs for educational- appropriate activities, including integration into curriculum. Every staff member (including administrators) must demonstrate proficiency in basic technology skills (spreadsheets, word processing, searching, etc.); it offers training for those who need assistance. They encourage informal professional development through a large teacher workroom with technology systems and planning time so teachers can work together."
* **Turkey**: " FATIH Project (Project for Enhancing the Possibilities and Improving the Technology). This policy supports the Turkish Development Plan. The project states that all classrooms will be equipped with ICT tools and that ICT-supported instruction will be practiced in all classes. To support the training of teachers for using ICTs in the classrooms, online and face-to-face professional development activities have been planned to support approximately 600,000 teachers."
* summer institute for teachers and administrator
* **New Zealand**: "In New Zealand each school develops its own policies based on the national policy goals: “For New Zealand, the development of a prosperous and confident knowledge society means the development of new skills and knowledge. It will require a culture of continuous enquiry, innovation and improvement, risk taking, and entrepreneurship. This can only come from the education system” (Ministry of Education, 2006, p. 3)." (6)

#### Commonalities of successful approaches

All:

* address the individual needs of teachers
* focus on creating a culture that supports technology integration, peer-to-peer interaction and risk-taking
* incorporate technology into the overall goals and directions of curriculum work in school
* recognize that ICT integration must be situated within content ares and pedagogical approaches in schools (7)

### ICTs: both the cause and the solution

"The need for an effective use of ICTs in schools and the existence of clear guidelines for teacher competencies in this area has created an additional and urgent need for more effective professional development for teachers. At the same time, the effective use of ICTs also provides a part of the solution for this challenge, since each of the characteristics necessary for effective professional development, as identified by Garet et al. (2001), can be attained through the use of ICTs in professional development. For example, the first characteristic, duration (longer is better), has been problematic for educators. In the past, it was relatively easy to bring in experts and have them work with teachers for a given period of time, but in many cases there was little follow-up for the teachers after the experts departed. In contrast, today interactive ICTs provide an ideal set of tools to sustain contact and communication with experts over long periods of time and to obtain feedback from these experts on specific classroom challenges. 

Similarly, teachers used to face immense challenges in regard to the second characteristic, collective participation (of groups of teachers from the same school, department, or grade), since many of them spent most of their working hours confined in classrooms with learners. Using ICTs, teachers can now communicate, create, and problem-solve with their colleagues at times convenient to their schedules, and therefore are no longer as isolated from professional contact and stimulation. In addition, using ICTs to deliver professional development can greatly expand the teachers’ networks of colleagues and experts. Teachers with high levels of ICT use and experience can connect with others at the same high level, and this way they can collectively work to develop their skills and thus become professional development leaders for their schools and localities. 

We are in an exciting time with a combination of important factors coexisting:
* Urgent need for effective ICT use in schools. 
* Knowledge of effective strategies for implementing change. 
* High-quality international ICT competency frameworks and standards for teachers. 
* Knowledge of effective professional development approaches. 
* Availability of ICTs to provide professional development for teachers." (8)

### National policy

"According to Kozma, national policies tend to be established based on four major rationales: 

* Support for economic growth. 
* Promotion of social interaction and development. 
* Advancement of education reform. S
* upport for education management. 

The work of countries that have established successful policies can serve as a model to others working to implement such policies. For example, Singapore has a long tradition of linking education policy to the economic system, and the country’s latest ICT Master Plan provides a good example of this approach. Jordan is another nation that has designed a national ICT plan to establish a knowledge economy. Highlighting the social impact of ICTs is a rationale especially attractive to developing countries, and work done in Chile provides a good example of policies emphasizing access in rural schools. Australia and South Africa both provide good examples of countries where national ICT policy is focused on issues that advance education reform. Finally, several countries have included policies based on the use of ICTs for management issues such as assessment and student attendance data. Malaysia is one country taking the lead in this area (Kozma, 2008)." (9)

## Types of teacher professional development

### Which

standardized, site-based

### How effective are
Tako tako. Učitelji potrebujejo več spodbude in več časa, so preobremenjeni, zato idej ne morejo uporabiti v praksi. 

### How could be more effective?
Bolje bi bilo manj izobraževanja in več časa za načrtovanje.

### What I've learned
Poleg obveznega izobraževanja bi bila zelo dobra možnost, da bi se upoštevalo tudi učiteljevo samoizobraževanje, saj se učitelj izobražuje za stvari, ki so trenutno zanj najpomembnejše.
