# 5.2.1 Dealing with potential pitfalls

## Issues: Jocelyn Bennett (Pope memorial elementary school, Quebec, Canada):

* kako se izognemo copying and pasting: naredimo tabelico, učenci v okence na kratko (5 besed) opišejo, kaj so izvedeli in napišejo vir. Za naslednjo spletno stran pišejo v drugo okence. Na koncu povzamejo vsebino iz vseh okenc. (obnovijo, povejo s svojimi besedami, pokažejo razumevanje, sinteza, kritično mišljenje, izberejo, kar se jim zdi pomembno)
* Nič ne pišejo, ko iščejo, ampak šele potem!
* which websites: kritično razmišljanje, kje so dobili informacijo (edu. educational ...)
* media literacy: na vidnem mestu vprašanja, ki si jih učenci zastavljajo: who create this message, why ... (rules to follow)
* če pridejo na neprimerno spletno stran, pokličejo učiteljico, pokažejo, kaj so našli, ona pove, ali je primerno ali ne. Na ta način se naučijo, da je povsem normalno, da naletijo na neprimerno vsebino, to se na internetu pač dogaja. (učitelj potem blokira tisto spletno stran)
* children become problem-solvers with ipads
* we should ask students every time: "Where this information come from? (končnice .edu, .si ..."

## Practical aspects of using ICT well (forum)

### Tips of helping students use ICT well

* write in point what they have gathered from the websites that teacher has given them
* in some schools parents and students are asked to sign a contract that outline the rules and the child's' responsibilities when using the schools internet. I think this is a great idea.
* guided questions that help students to find the information
* pre-selected websites
* učitelj učencem pokaže, kako se uporablja internet (we google topics together, click on links and then discuss as a group why a certain website seems credible or not; name of organization, date updated ...)
* učitelj učencem pokaže odgovore, ki so raznoliki: npr. katera država je najboljša na svetu. da vidijo raznolike odgovore, ali celo stran z napačnimi podatki, npr. wikipedijo, in učenci potem to popravljajo
* research template, that they would then fill in; it guides them through the process (rather than doign it for them, or having them struggle and feel overwhelmed with the process). Outlines and templates are useful, and can be used over and over again.
* The first lesson every school year (September) which uses technology should be devoted to agreeing an Acceptable Use Policy or Code of Conduct for using the technology.  If this is negotiated with the students they are more likely to abide by it and police it too.  Obviously, the teacher will use carefully thought out questions to ensure that the rules cover what needs to be covered.  Students then design swimming pool style posters (i.e. cartoons/images) illustrating the rules and the best one is adopted as the class technology rules for that year.  These can be sent home to parents so they are aware of the technology code of conduct at school.  These are referred to every lesson with a special emphasis in February on Safer Internet Day.
* check list with crucial point to check off to get an idea if a site is reliable or not
* netiquette rules; kako je nekomu nerodno in neprijetno, če je objavljena njegova neprijetna fotografija ali kaj podobnega
* takšne stvari tudi na spletni strani šole (da se lahko poduči kdorkoli)
* pomembno pri rabi ICT v šoli je, da se pri rabi razvija tudi kritično mišljenje in e-zrelost
* AdBlock: blokira nekatere reklame in neprijetne vsebine
* YouTube: na dnu strani : varnost: vklopljena/izklopljena
* težava, če starši nastavijo zelo stroge varnostne nastavitve in potem učenci kakšne strani ne morejo uprabljati. v tem primeru je dobro, če starši zaupajo učiteljem varnostne kode.
* časovna omejitev: 30 minut za raziskovanje; to pomaga, da ne zapravljajo časa za stvari, ki niso bistvene
* When planning an activity we have to keep in mind if it is meaningful for the students.
* extra classes on teaching how to do research, to write the presentation ...
* Power Searching with google
* šola postavi pravila, kaj se sme na internetu početi in kaj ne
* not to "overdo", ICT tools should be implemented where they are necessary & appropriate, in small amounts & not all of them at once. This way the usage of ICT will be useful & efficient
* noteboxes: note-taking skills
* rules in class: they keep students on task and prevent them from getting in touch with inappropriate materials
* 1 or 2 lessons showing the tips for a good research. It is important that the confidence of the teacher in showing simple and easy examples that will help students to  make a precise and safe research online. 

Anthippi Harou: "Some of the useful tips in the first video:

* The teacher helped the students exploit the internet to get a broader knowledge (through images and a variety of sources) of a word they wanted to look up. The students used their ipads to search for the word instead of their dictionaries.
* To avoid the copy and paste phenomenon, the teacher accompanied their work on the web with an information transfer paper activity. The students had to produce their works after using just a limited number of words they had extracted from specific websites they had visited.
* The teacher developed the students’ critical thinking regarding the validity of the websites they used to retrieve their information.
* She stated rules for students to follow. For example, if they came across an inappropriate site they should pause it and report it to the teacher. Only certain games (minecraft) were allowed to be played in class for a limited time.    
* She encouraged the students to be problem solvers in order to have a shared responsibility in the learning experience. When she had a problem with displaying a video one of the students offered the solution facilitating the lesson.
 
In the second video

The students were autonomous in their learning using a great amount of digital resources.  If I judge from the difference in the age of the students, there was some peer teaching from older and more digitally literate students to younger ones.

Below is just about everything you'll need to style in the theme. Check the source code to see the many embedded elements within paragraphs."

Maria Napal Fraile: 
"TO HELP JUDGING SOURCES CRITICALLY, an exercise we frequently do, especially at the beginning of the course, is to assign different groups the same question they have to research using different sources (group 1: wikipedia, kalipedia...; group 2: on-line enciclopedia (e.g. encarta): group 3: an educational website; group 4: informal users forums (Yahoo answers...)). We then gather together the information and make a joint analysis on various aspects:
- quality of the information. completeness. Are there mistakes? Is it updated?
- does it cite original sources? Is the writer identified and confidable? Is it objective?
- quality of the design. Grammar or spell mistakes.
- understandability and appropriateness of the content to their educational level

The objective is to know and be able to categorize information sources and develop a set of criteria to use them properly. The objective is not that every pupil gets convinced that Wikipedia is evil and educational webs are perfect. In fact, they learn some strategies to make the best of each tool (Press: novelty; Wikipedia: may be very useful to make a broad idea which can then be confirmed or completed in educational webs, enciclopedias or specialized sites)."

### Introducing new platforms

* Kako učencem pokažemo kako se dela z novimi pripomočki, stranmi, aplikacijami ...: Daniel Banks: "The best way around this I have found is to use [www.screencastomatic.com](www.screencastomatic.com) to make the explanation as a video file and then post it on the LMS. The kids can then watch it in their own time if necessary. As an extension of this, I have started getting my students to practise their English further by making their own video explanations of how to use the different websites we use in class."
* Lahko ga pogledajo že vnaprej (pred uro), tako da potem ne bodo imeli težav pri delu (pomanjkanje časa)


# 5.2.2 Recognising the issues that must be prioritised

*Focus on pp [88 to 93](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/ictinprimary/unesco_book/Chapter_4_Limitations_and_concerns.pdf) in Kalaš, I., Laval, E., Laurillard, D., Lim, C.P., Meyer, F., Musgrave, S., Senteni, A., Tokareva, N., Turcsányi-Szabó, M. (2014). ICT in Primary Education: Volume 2 Policy, Practices, and Recommendations. Moscow, Russian Federation: UNESCO Institute for Information Technologies in Education.*  

## Limitations and concerns
### 1. Obstacles and problems

* financial issues
* lack of technical staff
* outaded, obsolete technology and infrastructure, quality of internet connection, not enough computers, lack of space, equipment, not enough materials
* professional development: lack of trust and innovation
* time (for teacher to become comfortable using ICT)
* support by school leaders
* family contexts: parents' opinion on the real value of ICT, parents who don't respect the rules of internet use, the differences between children who has and who hasn't have internet at home. some parents don't allow their daughters to email, different levels of digital literacy between pupils (2)

### 2. Concerns

* Technological literacy
* security, privacy
* funding
* impact of the ICT on education and children's learning, the quality of education
* relations with families

### 3. Sharing - suggestions how to overcome the callenges

* Training: the importance of the professional development of staff
* Infrastructure: well thought out and supported; goce ICT a real focus and value in the school
* parent: they should be involved and supported
* culture: part of the school culutre; encourage ICT specialists, pedagogical coordinators and teachers to collaborate with each other; promotion team; club of modern teachers

### Digital Leaders

Učenci kot Digital Leaders - izberejo tiste, ki najbolj obvladajo in ki jih to najbolj zanima. odgovorni so za "distribution, collection, charging and storage of mobile devices in the school. They ensure that the devices are in the classroom when they are needed. Digital Leaders are also able to support teahcers in computing lessons."

Benefits of using Digital Leaders are: 
* Supporting the computing lessons, so they begin to realise that they have to be able to give instructions fluently and be flexible in social negotiation. 
* Practising the ability to provide instructions and explanations for a variety of student colleagues. 
* Scaffolding the learning process for other less able students. 
* Reflecting regularly on their practice and implementation in training sessions with each other and with the teacher. 
* Enabling teachers to use mobile devices more often in their lessons since they do not have to ensure that they are charged, or collected, they merely have to book them out. 

"It is also very important for the teacher to give space for a time where Digital Leaders can feed back to each other and to the teacher, and reflect on their experience of how they were able to support or lead sessions." (12) 

### 4. Prevention

* In one school, the children define rules together and create posters and booklets
* share rules on the school website
* workshops for teachers

What can we do? > učenci sami rešujejo probleme

Teachers are learning from each others teaching practice.
