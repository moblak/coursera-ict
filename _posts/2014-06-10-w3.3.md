# 3.3.1 Children are born to learn
Children being born to learn provide teachers with "the chances to deploy suitable learning activities that could contribute to the deep learning that children need in order to meet curriculum objectives and skills development".

Now we know more than we did about how we learn and what makes up human intelligence that extraordinary.

We should allow their natural curiosity to flourish.

Skills in the cognitive domain revolve around three critical heirarchical arranged skills:

* knowledge
* compregension
* critical thinking

Student Learning Objctive: 
* The taxonomy refers to a classification of the different objectives that educators set for students.
* Strong student learning objectives will have students regularly engaging in higher order critical thinking skills.

> "So remember and create lessons that have students enaged in high order critical thinking skills ... skills for 21st century learnres!"

"What is Bloom's taxonomy?

Benjamin Bloom developed, in 1956, at the University of Chicago, his theory on Educational Objectives. He proposed 3 domains or areas:
Cognitive - person's ability to process and utilize information (thinking), this is what Bloom's Digital Taxonomy is based on
Affective - This is the role of feeling and attitudes in the learning/education process
Psychomotor - This is manipulative or physical skills
Bloom's Taxonomy is a taxonomy of activities and behaviours that exemplify Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) and Lower Order Thinking Skills (LOTS). Bloom's allows to rank and structure different classroom activities and plan the learning process. In the 2001, Lorin Anderson and other revised Bloom's original work to give us Bloom's Revised Taxonomy.

blooms_revised_taxomony.jpg
Bloom's Taxonomy in its various forms represents the process of learning.

Before we can understand a concept we have to remember it
Before we can apply the concept we must understand it
Before we analyse it we must be able to apply it
Before we can evaluate its impact we must have analysed it
Before we can create we must have remembered, understood, applied, analysed, and evaluated.

Some people may argue about that you do not require some of the stages for each and every task, action or process; some too may argue about the necessity to reach the creation level for all activities. This is the choice of the individual.
Bloom's Digital Taxonomy isn't about the tools or technologies rather it is about using these to facilitate learning. Outcomes on rubrics are measured by competence of use and most importantly the quality of the process or product. For example. Bookmarking a resource is of no value if the resource is inappropriate or worthless." ([Sandhya on the forum](https://class.coursera.org/ictinprimary-001/forum/thread?thread_id=27))

**Doing** -isolated information. Focus on completing measurable task. 

**Connecting** - connecting thinking. Simple connections made within a context. Compare and share.

**Applying** - applying understaning of connections explored.

**Conceptualizing** - develop conceptula understanding of big ideas.

**Evaluating** - evaluating and critiquing to explore the limitations and potential of information, sources or process.

**Creating** - creativity, applying ideas, processes and/or experiences to develop a new reality.

**Sharing** - sharing the new knowledge through authentic context and gaining feedback to measure value.

## Connecting digital learning activities to Bloom's taxonomy (forum)

### My ideas
In history you can be very creative and use lots of different tools.

* **Creating**: making a movie (Movie Maker), making a presentation (for example on Thinglink - you can use pictures, mindmapping, videos ...), for example a photostory, PowerPoint/Prezi, Glogster, making advertisements (Movie Maker), programming, making an animation, storytelling, writing a poem in Text Layout, making an infographic, creating a website. 

* **Evaluating**: comments on blog posts, podcasts, making a presentation, publishing (blog, wiki, forum, social network, modelling), (peer) reviewing, e-portfolio, moderating a web conference or an online chat, collaborating, networking, making a poster (on Fake Movie Poster), liking others post on social networks, writing on blog (deciding which information to publish)

* **Analyzing**: making a report or presentation in different media/tools, making spreadsheets, diagrams, tagging

* **Applying**: collaborative working on documents in the cloud (Google Docs), game based learning, making presentations, collaborative working on wikis, making podcasts, playing, editing, sharing, virtual trips and exhibitions

* **Understanding**: writing a post on blog, forum, recording podcasts, midmapping, advanced searches, twitting, categorizing (e. g. on Pinterest boards)

* **Remembering**: quizes, web browsing, (social) bookmarking, bullet pointing, highlighting, social networking. 

Sometimes it's more efficient to start with easier tasks (lower levels: remembering, understanding) and build on it, and sometimes it's better to start with creating and than learn content from evaluating to understanding and remembering.

Practical ideas for teaching history (individual and/or collaborative):

* **creating**: 
  - (find and) use the plan to make a trebuchet. Try to make it.
  - On Facebook make a quiz which assess what we've learned about the Ilirian Provinces. Publish it and share with your classmates.
  - Role play: with classmates make a play about rebelious farmers, planning the rebelion against their landlord. The play will be filmed, edited (Movie Maker ...) and published online.
  - On vlog/wiki write a post about farmers' rebellions.
  - Twitt about Mesopotamia.
  - Make a presentation about the ancient Egyip. Use different sources.
  - Make a documentary movie about medieval town of Škofja Loka (local history).
  - Write an essay about the beginning of WW1 and publish it on wiki. Share it with your classmates.
  - Make an animation about Napoleon Bonaparte's life.
  - Write a short novel about Julius Caesar's life (on Storybird or any other storytelling tool).

* **Evaluating**:
  - The people of US used to be afraid of communism. But - should they be? Explain. Make a podcast and publish it on the blog.
  - What was the qualitiy of life in the ancient Rome comparing to medieval Europe? The comparison publish on wiki.
  - Via online conference present the everyday in ancient Rome.
  - On the blog there's an article about the reasons for the beginning of the WW1. What do you think about the article? What is good, what is missing? Write your comment.
  - What's the most important thing you've learned during the lesson? Make a note in your e-portfolio.
  - Moderate an online conference on the ww2.

* **Analysing**:
  - Compare Musolini's government to the one of Hitler's. Make a presentation. Publish it online and share with your classmates on the class blog.
  - Make a fake Facebook profile of Julius Caesar (on Fake book).
  - WHat would happen it Slovenians wouldn't decide to be an independent country? Your opininon write on the forum.
  - Draw a graph showing the grofth ob population in the times of industrial revolution.
  - Search for three cartoons from the ww1. Pin them to Pinterest.

* **Applying**:
  - Make a comic with 4 pictures showing how the invasion of the barbarians  affect the life of Romans.
  - Make a spreadsheet of advantages and disadvantages of Napoleon's army and English army at the battle of Waterloo. Publish it on your blog or share the document with your classmates.
  - Make an advertisement/poster for people to choose living in Yugoslavia and not Austria. Publish it online or on the social network.
  - Play game Discovery Babylon.
  - On the web look for a video about Illirian provinces. Share it with your classmates.
  - Look out for a web page about ww1 that you would recommend to someone whowould like to learn about that time. Share the link wizh others on your social network.

* **Understanding**
  -  Write about the first punic war (blog, wiki, social network).
  -  On the blog read the post about the brothers' Gracchus reforms. In the comments section write, why they were necessary.
  -  With your words write a definition of democracy.
  -  On the link [Milet](http://www.zgodovinarka.si/milet/) read about the polis of Miletus and then go to a virtual tour at ancient city. Which buildings have you noticed? Why they were used for? Write a comment on the blog.

* **Remembering**
 -  On Pinterest pin 3 pictures from the Battles of the Isonzo. 
 -  Answer the quiz.
 -  On the web look out for the name of the Carthaginian military commander, who went to Italy over the Alps and attack Rome.
  -  On the social network write, what you've learned the most during lesson.
  -  Write the definition of colony (dictionary in the Moodle).


### Ideas from others

* Nisreen Hmeidani: **Create a story**: "I will prepare my lesson plan according to Boom's Taxonomy. My students will search on the internet for different characters, and settings to save them on a file. The students will sit in small groups to compare their pictures , Then they will use prezi to download the pictures and information as slides. Each group will create their own story from the pictures, with the help of the teacher they will add their voices telling the story. The students will do posters that will represent the story. At the end each group will present their work and the other groups will go round and discuss the posters and ask questions." Sites for storytelling: Storybird (but there are not so many choices), Scribble my story (iPad app), story jumper.
* Regina Anastasopoulou: **Representing History**: "I always found history as an opportunity to use more instruments in teaching. So, representing with model clay a history myth is exciting for kids at the age of 7-9. At first, we read the myth, we understand the characters, we decide the small groups that will play a specific role, we make the models, take pictures and at the end we create with Movie Maker the story. In this way, HOTS and LOTS are easy to to be pointed out."
* Roger R. Marcellus-Litvin: teaching **literature**: In class, we use the e-versions of the books displayed on the Interactive Whiteboard. Each book has the text as well as pictures. We read through the books and talk about what's going on in the story as well as how the actions in the story relate to the illustrations. In this activity the students utilize the following:

Doing: they must recognize and describe the characters and situations in the books, locate information pertaining to the story

Connecting: they must (by the story's end) be able to summarize what the story was about, infer meaning from the text about the characters and the situations the characters are placed in

Applying: through the worksheets and activities the students: use the grammar structures and vocabulary they have learned to discuss the story in writing 

Conceptualizing: creating an outline of the events in the story and linking them to show order

Evaluating: compare the current story with past stories, explain what happened and why it happened

Creating: write their own stories incorporating elements (grammar structures and vocabulary specifically, and, on occasion, characters and situations) from the text

Sharing: presenting their story to the class and fielding questions about their story

* Deepti Khanna: "It is important to remember that students can’t just jump to creating complex products and ideas (the highest level) if they haven’t mastered some lower level skills such as remembering and understanding. If students don’t remember or understand the information they are studying, they are unlikely to be able to apply it in a new situation or analyze and evaluate it to develop products or ideas.
For Example:
After reading a story about the farm, students traditionally write a fact about an animal (Remember) and draw a picture to illustrate to show the fact (Understand). In the Let’s Go To the Farm! lesson, students use Pixie or Wixie to create a class Web site about farm animals. This Web site will provide information about what each farm animal eats, the animal’s job on the farm, the sound the farm animal makes, and a picture of the animal. While this lesson certainly includes the same lower level thinking skills a traditional approach uses, it also requires students to analyze the material, make decisions, and create an end product that showed understanding.
Revised Blooms Taxonomy shows HOTS to LOTS:

Create - create a class web site.

Evaluate - decide which information should be put on the site.

Analyze - determine the facts about each animal - sounds, jobs, what they eat, etc.

Apply - use information from one source (books, etc ) in another (web site).

Understand - summarize what they have learned about animals.

Remember - recall facts about the animals."

## Bloom's Taxonomy and ICT (forum)

* Imtiaz Fatima: "In designing any learning activity keeping in mind Bloom's Taxonomy, we need to think of a combination of ICT and non ICT activities  for students."

# 3.3.3 Where can I fand tools for learning activities? (unfinished, optional)

"Explore and Select tools from the [**Learning Technologies Pearltree**](http://www.pearltrees.com/tetlab/learning-technologies/id3219833) which includes free-to-use technologies you could make good use of in your activities. Pearltrees is a networking site where you can share and comment on structured sets of links from pearls. You might like to build one of these as you go through the course, and keep it for later reference, gathering external contributions to enrich your own collections."

More tools: [**Centre for Learning & Performance Tools**](http://c4lpt.co.uk/directory-of-learning-performance-tools/).

*To do: Create an activity in your Course Journal selecting a learning type using one of the selected tools. Explain how it relates to Bloom's Taxonomy.*


# 3.3.4 How can I build my own collection of tool
"Create your own Pearltree selecting and inserting pearls that would be interesting to use later on.  It is free to register providing your email, or connecting with FaceBook, Twitter or Google account. Have a look at some Fguiding videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB7hXQPMkE1JMIC0qsrj-2w). (Please note, that the layout skin of Pearltrees has just recently been changed, but the functionality remained and even improved.)
Structure your pearls according to meaningful categories."

# 3.3.5 So how can the overall skills of children be developed?

## 21st Century Skills

## ATCS: What are 21st Century Skills?

###"What Are 21st-Century Skills?

Learning to collaborate with others and connect through technology are essential skills in a knowledge-based economy.

ATC21S started with a group of more than 250 researchers across 60 institutions worldwide who categorized 21st-century skills internationally into four broad categories:

* **Ways of thinking**. Creativity, critical thinking, problem-solving, decision-making and learning
* **Ways of working**. Communication and collaboration
* **Tools for working**. Information and communications technology (ICT) and information literacy
* **Skills for living in the world**. Citizenship, life and career, and personal and social responsibility

###Putting Concepts Into Practice
The ATC21S project has now moved from conceptual to practical, working with two skills that span all four categories:

* **Collaborative problem-solving.** Working together to solve a common challenge, which involves the contribution and exchange of ideas, knowledge or resources to achieve the goal.
* **ICT literacy — learning in digital networks.** Learning through digital means, such as social networking, ICT literacy, technological awareness and simulation. Each of these elements enables individuals to function in social networks and contribute to the development of social and intellectual capital."
