# Introductory presentation

"Computational thinking is nowadays recognized in more and more countries as an important part of the skills for the 21st century learning. In several countries it has recently been integrated into national curricula for several stages - including primary education - sometimes even as a separate core subject. Some schools from our survey already have a lot of experience in this context, using programmable digital toys, educational robotics sets, educational programming languages like Scratch, Logo, Kodu or others."

* **If we can develop content, we are more powerful.** Če učitelji pripravijo svoje vsebine, so bolje pripravljeni na poučevanje in za doseganje učnih ciljev. "They are more powerful. And the same is with their pupils. If they are able to develop things, not only use them, they are better prepared to cope with this world. Such development sometimes takes the form of programming. If our pupils learn how to program, they will be able to produce digital artefact to create digital objects instead of merely consuming them."
* **Computational thinking, programming, computing**. Above are the reasons why they are getting so much attention. National curriculum in England: *"A high quality computing education equips pupils to use computational thinking and creativity to uderstand and change the world."* 
* The process of developing early computational thinking and educational programming **can start very early**, for example, by exploiting programmabe digital toys like bee-bots.

## What does it mean: programming, computational thinking?

### Programming

= when we are not directly manipulating things, but specify their behavior to occur at some future time.

For that, we use certain language: a programming language.

We can control things and objects, plan and modify their behaviors, solve problems, explore world and change it, create meaningful digital artefacts (for example games).

### Computational thinking

Important skill for learning and living in this world.

= formulating and solving problems (by the means of programming and digital technology)

It can provide valuable opportunities for primary students: to explore, discover, create, modify, share, collaborate.

There are more resources for teachers how to develop computational thinking of their students.

### Models of implementating ICT/informatics into education

* When ICT is **integrated across primary curriculum** it most often focuses on using ICT for supporting different teaching goals. 
* When ICT is implemented as a **seperate subject**, it usually focuses on using ICT to create presentations, video, drawings, animations, to look for information or to communicate. Focuses on developing basic computer literacy.
* More systematic **computing or informatics or computer science as a subject**. It focuses on understanfing basic principles and concept of computer science, and most of all, on formulating problems and solving them through programming.

### Programmable digital toys

* different toys: to be programmed to behave in acertain way and solve a problem, inspect, animate.
* usually this are small robots with some keys to make it move, turn, play a sound and replay the same behaviour
* toys can easily be integrated in various learning situations in a socially rich context


### Educational programming

* programming environments: Scratch, Kodu, Logo, Python
* building sequences of instructions, repetitions of steps, selections from sets of options
* usually this happens in visual, intuitive and  interactive way. Students build certain products and do experiments.

### Educational robotics

Exceptional opportunities for students to construct, create, and control.

### Computational thinking

* puropse of study
* used in other subjects
* development of 21st C skills

# Reading and reflection

## ICT in present-day schools: different models of implementations

[‘ICT in Primary Education. Volume 1: Exploring the origins, settings and initiatives’](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/ictinprimary/week4/vol1%20section%202.4.pdf), pages 36-38.

"[C]ountries use a variety of strategies to protect the safety of children while they access the Internet. In spite of that, nearly all countries – no matter which religion or value system they adhere to – agree that school (including its primary level) ought to develop students’ digital skills, digital literacy, and appropriate digital behaviour as part of developing 21st century skills. To reach this goal, there are different strategies and models of implementation, with varied values and priorities."

3 main models:

### a) ICT integrated across the curriculum

= incorporated in subjects to enahnce particular learning outcomes

* cross-curricular relations between subjects
* ICT has motivating and mediating role
* oportunities to develop 21st C skills
* the success of this model depend on the level of digital literacy of teachers (ICT skills, experience, innovativeness, new digital pedagogies, personal capacity and interest to create new teaching and learning environments and cooperate with other teachers)

> Asking whether technology can improve education is like asking whether experiments can improve science education. Everything depends on what kind of technology is introduced, how it is used, its design and how teachers are supported to use it.
R. Noss, Director of Technology Enhanced Learning Research Programme (in “UK Science & Technology”, issue 3)

### b) ICT as a distinc curriculum subject

= focus on developing basic computer literacy, productive use of common office applications, presentation and multimedia tools, databases, information systems and web search, drawing environments ...

Risk: teachers of other subjects may be insulated drom the cirtical need to integrate ICT to their own teaching processes. (36)

### c) CS as a distinc curriculum subject

Broader goals.

= developing understanding of elementary CS concepts and skills:

* digital literacy (basic knowledge, skills and concepts of informatics and computers; computer literacy, applications, safety)
* programming or computational thinking
* problem solving (logical reasoning, justification, argumentation)
* data handling

## [National curriculum in England: Computing at Key Stage 1 and 2](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/239033/PRIMARY_national_curriculum_-_Computing.pdf)

"A high-quality computing education equips pupils to use computational thinking and creativity to understand and change the world. Computing has deep links with mathematics, science, and design and technology, and provides insights into both natural and artificial systems. The core of computing is computer science, in which pupils are taught the principles of information and computation, how digital systems work, and how to put this knowledge to use through programming. Building on this knowledge and understanding, pupils are equipped to use information technology to create programs, systems and a range of content. Computing also ensures that pupils become digitally literate – able to use, and express themselves and develop their ideas through, information and communication technology – at a level suitable for the future workplace and as active participants in a digital world."


## [Resources on Computational Thinking by ISTE](https://www.iste.org/learn/computational-thinking)

"Advances in computing have expanded our capacity to solve problems at a scale never before imagined, using strategies that have not been available to us before. Students will need to learn and practice new skills — computational thinking (CT) skills — to take full advantage of these revolutionary changes brought about by rapid changes in technology. ISTE and the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) are collaborating on a project to prepare young learners to become computational thinkers who understand how today's digital tools can help solve tomorrow's problems. CT is vital to all students as we work to raise the level of achievement, prepare students for global competitiveness and blend academics with real life."

What skills do students need to be prepared for the future?

* creativity
* computing
* critical thinking
* problem solving
* communication
* collaboration

Computational Thinking = critical thinking skills + power of computing > now you have a foundation for making decisions or innovating solutions that can improve our quality of life

Computational thinking provides shared vocabulary and a framework to unify teachers' efforts.
