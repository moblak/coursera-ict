# 3.2.1 What are Learning Styles

This is a base "for integrating ICT into the teaching and learning process by emphasising the importance of productingy a variety of activities for students to choose from, either to fit with their style of learning, or on the contrary, to challenge them and build further competencies."

> "Learning style is an individual's natural or habitual pattern of acquiring and processing information in learning situations. A core concept is that individuals differ in how they learn." [Wikipedia: Learning Styles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_styles)

There are 6 different learning styles: visual, auditory, tactile, kinesthetic and group, individual. 

## Visual

You learn from seeing words.

* You should take notes of lectures and oral directions if you want to remember the information. 
* don't need as much oral explanation
* better if you read
* you can often learn alone

## Auditory

You learn form hearing words spoken and from oral presentations.

* You benefit from making tapes to listen to, by teaching other students, and by conversing with your teacher.
* You may remmeber information by reading aloud.

## Kinesthetic

You learn best by experience.

* A combination of stimuli will help you understand new material.
* You remember information well when you actively participate in activities.

## Tactile

You learn best when you have the opportunity to do "hands on" experiences with materials.

* Writing notes or instructions can help you remember information, and physical involvement in class.
* Touching and working are the most successful learning.

## Individual

You learn best when you work alone.

* You make better progress in learning when you work by yourself.


## Group

You learn more easily when you study with at least one other student.

* Group work helps you learn and understand new information.

# 3.2.2 Oportunities for Learning Types

## What does  the research literature say about ICT in primary education 

Source: [UNESCO: ICT in Primary Education, Vol. 1. (2012)](http://iite.unesco.org/pics/publications/en/files/3214707.pdf), chapter 3. Pages 39-46.

"This chapter draws upon existing research and evaluation publications on how ICT has been used successfully or unsuccessfully in schools to enhance students’ learning outcomes, and identifies the conditions that support or hinder these ICT-mediated teaching and learning practices. For 
ICT to enhance teaching and learning, it needs to be supported by appropriate education 
and school policies and by effective professional development for teachers. Moreover, 
despite an increasing recognition of 21st century skills and competencies, there are certainly 
cases where a lack of ICT infrastructure, hardware and software in schools can deny students 
the opportunities to properly develop these competencies." (39)

### Opportunities Provided by ICT for Teaching and Learning in Primary Schools
ICT brings about "changes in learning and teaching activities, in curriculum, and in interprestonal relationships in the learning environment, and it is reciprocally affected by the very changes it causes. Therefore, the integration of ICT in schools must focus on the whole configuration of events, activities, contents, and interpersonal processes taking place in the context that ICT is used. Depending on the expected learning outcomes and activities, ICT 
plays different roles in the learning environment."

"Based on how an ICT tool is used in the classroom, Lim and Tay (2003) classified ICT tools into four types:

1. **Information tools**. These are applications that provide information in various formats (e.g., text, sound, graphics or video). Examples include multimedia encyclopedias or resources available in the World-Wide Web (www).
2. **Situating tools**. These are systems that situate students in an environment where they may “experience” a context and happenings. Such systems include simulations, games and virtual reality.
3. **Construction tools**. These are usually tools that can be used for manipulating 
information, organizing one’s ideas or representing one’s interpretations. For instance, mind mapping or social networking applications that allow students to organize their ideas or reflections, and communicate these ideas and share with others.
4. **Communication tools**. These are applications that facilitate communication between teacher and students or among students beyond the physical barrier (of space, time or both) of the classroom. The important examples are e-mail, e-conferencing and e-discussion boards."

+ ICT may also serve as **tutorial and diagnostic tools** and in other roles. In real classroom practice, ICT often serves more than one mediating role simultaneously.

#### Literacy

"Recent 
developments in educational psychology suggest that literacy is best taught within a context that stimulates problem solving and analysis along with reading, writing, and ICT literacy ompetencies. ICT can offer such learning opportunities (Alfassi, 2000). Recent developments in educational psychology suggest that literacy is best taught within a context that stimulates problem solving and analysis along with reading, writing, and ICT literacy competencies. ICT can offer such learning opportunities (Alfassi, 2000)." (40)

##### ICT information tools
*The Alfassi (2000) study:* 

There are different possible assignment tasks that engage students in meaningful inquires  while using ICT information tools. (40-41)

Information tools:
* internet
* CD-ROMs

Students use it critically to determine if the information is accurate, relevant and useful.

Students also perepared electronic presentations, in whic

"The students also prepared electronic presentations in which texts were written, read and animated with accompanied music or sound effects. Through these electronic presentations, they improved literacy and communication skills because such presentations required them to interact with each other while using various forms of speech, symbols and logical analysis.

The study (Alfassi 2000) found that after using ICT-enabled information tools, the students had significantly improved on their reading comprehension and writing." (40-41)

##### ICT tutorial tools
Studies: 
* Lirola and Cuevas (2008): "they found that by using a combination of computer programs students improved their writing"
* Edwards, Monaghan and Knight (2000) "argue that bilingual stories in interactive software provide a basis for activities and discussion and can increase students’ language awareness and foster their positive attitudes towards language learning."
* Brooks et al.’s (2006): in this study "a computer program was designed to enhance students’ reading and spelling through phonological awareness."" 
* "Software is particularly useful for students having special needs. Research has shown that students with reading problems learn to decode words more effectively when given speech feedback. For example, Wise, Ring, and Olson (2000) found that computerized phonological training supports accurate decoding in reading. 
* Fasting and Lyster (2005): software can be used to "alleviate the problem of keeping-on-track and accidental skipping, by for instance highlighting words or lines in response to 
simple keystrokes". 
* Watts and Lloyd (2004): ICT tutorial tools "allow students to navigate to different areas of a package depending on their personal interests or needs".

##### ICT situating tools

**Virtual world** should be a good multimedia device, constructive to literacy learning both behaviorally and psychologically (Mercahnt 2010). The Barnsborough virtual world was specifically designed for literacy learning and problem-solving. Merchant found that most participating students expressed a sense of enjoyment, motivation and enagement when talking about their experience in virtual world. Teachers agree that Barnsborough was a useful situating tool for real-world lireracy learning and teaching.

"Ariew and Ercetin (2004) found that students had positive feelings toward **hypermedia reading**."

"As for **writing**, Watts and Lloyd (2004) focused on the impact of a multimedia package called “Espresso”. The interactive nature of the materials encouraged collaborative work; the real and up-to-date nature of the materials provided clear motivation for students and the space for creativity. Learning with Espresso allowed students to be active learners as materials came with audio-visual effects, and these could be selected, rewound and fast-forwarded, thus allowing students to control their own learning."

[*Merchant, G. (2010). 3D virtual worlds as environments for literacy learning. Educational Research, 52(2), pp. 135-150.*](http://shura.shu.ac.uk/1206/1/Final_GM_Ed_Res.pdf)

##### ICT construction tools

* **Digital storytelling**: refers to the art of telling stories with a variety of digital multimedia (images, audio, video). It can be an effective means for literacy instruction.
* **Podcasts**. Halsey (2007) encouraged her students to use podcasts and **online publishing** as a new ways to learn literacy. Students were excited. (41) They also honed their skillsin reading, speaking, listening, writing. Publishing students' work online provided an audience and therefore an authentic purpose for learning. Halsey believes that tearning with teachnologies supports a constructivist approach for learnih and is most eddective when students are allowed autonomy over their own learning process. 
* **3D digital movie making software** was used by students in Australia to tell stories and develop their literacy and thinking, selfmanagement, planning and other skills (Chand,er, O'Brien and Unsworth 2010).

*Chandler, P., O’Brien, A., and Unsworth, L. (2010). Towards a 3D digital multimodal curriculum for the upper primary school. Australian Educational Computing, 25(1), pp. 34-40.*

##### ICT communication tools

Communication tools such as **e-mail** may contribute to students’ acquisition and performance in writing:
* Shang (2007) found that students who are regular users of e-mail showed improvement in their writing performance and independent thinking. 
* Biesenbach-Lucas, Meloni and Weasenforth (2000) found that e-mail is effective to practise cohesive devices such as demonstrative pronouns, sentence connectors, and summative expressions. 

Communication tools such as **chat rooms** may also be used together with other multimedia packages such as e-books. 
* Lai and Zhao (2006) found that students in a text-based online chat room noticed more language usage errors than in face-to-face conversations. 

Hartley (2007) states that **ICT-mediated writing** can release students from dealing with many problems associated with writing by hand – like letter formation and alignment – and hence facilitate editing, rewriting and spelling. Freedom from these chores allows them more time for thinking and reflecting about the content of writing.

**Blogging** "has been deployed in primary education for the purpose of literacy instruction."
* "In Halsey’s (2007) study in a New Zealand primary school, a class website was built jointly by the teacher and the children allowed them to publish and share their works with parents, children from other schools, and the general public." 
* "In his paper advocating use of blogs to promote literacy in the classroom, Huffaker (2005) argues that the characteristics of having a personal space and interconnections among an online community promotes individual expressions and collaborative interactions in the form of storytelling and dialogue; paper reports use of blogging for literacy instruction in different age groups in primary schools, for writing and allowing communication and sharing among teachers and students." (42)

#### 21st century skills
"With the help of the Internet and technologies for communication, visualization, and simulation, students can be offered a more authentic learning experience. /.../ ICT is likely to be advantageous for the acquisition of 21st century, skills which include ways of thinking, ways of working, tools for working and skills for living in the world".

##### ICT construction tools
"Yang’s (2009) study provides an example of the benefits of using ICT in an oral history course. Yang examined primary school students’ affective attitudes and cognitive perceptions in order to understand the challenges and opportunities that students faced in the project. The findings indicated the benefits that learners perceived around learning the importance of teamwork, knowing how to design a homepage, having a unique experience, learning more about history, learning interviewing techniques, and learning how to undertake a research project. The project provided an opportunity for students to sharpen their skills in problem solving and enhance their historical thinking. The most obvious outcome of this project was the students’ sense of accomplishment and pride along with an increase in self-growth (e.g. confidence, self-esteem, responsibility, and  greater empathy for elderly people. The students reported how they learned to see that historical issues can be viewed from a variety of standpoints, and how the standard history that is taught reflects the views of the dominant culture of the time." (45-46)

##### ICT situating tools and communicating tools

Computer game Atlantis - set against the story of the city of Atlantis. It helps students to learn English, Mathematics and Science by role-playing and solving problems. Students were enaged, motivated and there was a positive effect on social commitment. (46)

## Pedagogical changes achievable thorugh ICT. Types of learning

Learning with technology may happen through different types of activities (different perspectives on learning that cover all these type of things which are different type of activities). The literature offers various deﬁnitions and classiﬁcations of these types of learning/taxonomies.
* Diana Laurillard (2012): Teaching as a design science. 6 learning types: acquisition, discussion, investigation, practice, collaboration, production. Each learning type corresponds to different learning experiences that can be achieved through different activities often combining several learning types, and using either conventional technologies (e.g. books), or digital technologies (e.g. iBooks). The best learning environment combines all these types of learning.
* Bloom's taxonomy.
* [Nesta: Decoding Learning. The proof, promise and potential of digital education](http://www.nesta.org.uk/sites/default/files/decoding_learning_report.pdf) (2012). Another taxonomy of types of learning, and how ICT can facilitate: Learning from experts, Learning with others, Learning through making, Learning through exploring, Learning through inquiry, Learning through practicing, Learning through assessment, Learning in and across settings.

## Interesting examples of ICT-based learning activities

Learning styles incorporate those cognitive charasteristics that play relevant role in the learning process. 


## Kolb

Kolb's theory models the learning process, where learners start out from concrete experiences and basic theory leading to new situations and behaviour. 

It models learning as a 4 phased process:

1. concrete experience
2. reflective observation
3. abstract conceptualisation
4. active experimentation

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/kolb.PNG">
  <figcaption><a href="http://matchsz.inf.elte.hu/TT/LS/LS.html">Different Learning Styles and types of activities. On: ICT in Primary Education: Transforming children's learning across the curriculum, on Coursera</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

**Concrete**: they like open solutions in realistic situations. They like to learn together with others.

**Reflective: observers**. They aim at though investigation, objective desriptions and understanding.

**Abstract**: theory builders. Thinking, logical connections and concepts have important role in their learning. They like theories, order in work and clear conceptual systems.

**Active**: active explorer. They aim at the practical application of that learned. They like to symplify things and enjoy success.


**Divergent**: They are creative, they have strogn imagination and sensing. They are outstanding at being able to look at situations from different viewpoints and build on experiences. 

**Assimilative**: avstract conceptualisation and reflective observation is their basic ability. They are more interested in concepts than in practical applicaion. Strong features: inductive learning, theoretical modeling.

**Concergent**: they have a dominant ability for abstract conceptualisation and acitve experimentation. They are good at practical application of theories, information collection and solving problems.

**Accomodative**: taking part actively, executing tasks, producing and executing plans and experiments. They are mar more risk than others. Open, likes to buidl knowledge, activity is very important. They like to experiment actively and build concrete experiences.

## Honey and Mumford
Honey and Mumford learning style theory based on Kolb's Practical Learning Theory and is very similar to that of Kolb+s. It is often used to determine the learning styles of adults.

<figure>

  <figcaption><a href="http://matchsz.inf.elte.hu/TT/LS/LS.html">Different Learning Styles and types of activities. On: ICT in Primary Education: Transforming children's learning across the curriculum, on Coursera</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

**Active**: They prefer to work while actively performing tasks. They prioritise interactive activities.

**Reflective**: They prefer to go to the depth of information and re-think it. They prefer to start learning facts and information and they prefer to learn form print out.

**Theoretical**: They prefer to have a theoretical structure in order to master new information. They make good use of maped page strucutres, diagrams, which provide good background to learng.

**Pragmatic**: They like to search for reasons, they are interested in what works, what gives results. They prefer to map tasks onto themselves, they need speical applications to see connections and to see how assessment relates to competencies.

## Gregorc Thinking Style
It defines learning styles as an individuals preferred way of learning.

  <figcaption><a href="http://matchsz.inf.elte.hu/TT/LS/LS.html">Different Learning Styles and types of activities. On: ICT in Primary Education: Transforming children's learning across the curriculum, on Coursera</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

**Concrete - random**: like games, simmulation, solving tasks. Like Pragmatic style.

**Abstract - random**: prefer television, solving tasks, group discussions. Like activist.

**Abstract - sequential**: likes lectuers, books, individal learning. Like Reflective.

**Concrete - sequential**: logical and sequential, prefer programmed instruction, handbook, fieldtrip. Like Theoretical type.

## Gardner
According to Gardner's multiple intelligences theory, learners have 9 different kinds of intelligences which represent differences of individual and reflect different ways od interaction.

## Entwistle

Categorises learnres according to their aims, strategies and motivation while learning.

</figure>

**Depth**: It's important for themselves to understand the theories. They base new knowledge on previously learned knowledge, look for connections and make decisions accordingly. They take part actively in courses and are interested.

**Shallow**: They are externaly motivated and just wish to finish the course. They do not care for the whole, just try to find the parts that will be assessed and remember these parts. They perform the processes routinely and have problem with producing ideas. They learn without any specific strategy.

**Strategic learner**: Combine deap and shallow learning in order to produce best results.

## Felder-Silverman

Learners are dsecribed on 4 dimensions depending on how they prefer to process (active/reflective), perceive (sensing/intuitive), receive (visual/verbal) and understand (sequential/global) information.

## GEFT

Describes individuals in relation to their surroundings, which could be global (field dependant) who relates to the environment with general concepts and categories, while the analytical (field-independant), who can differentiate between details and grabs knowledge using concrete concepts and categories.

<figure>

</figure>

**Field-dependant**: relates to environment thorugh general, global concepts and categories. Likes cooperative learning, needs help, instruction, navigation and reinforcement. Likes to be told what methods to use. Likes to see the whole picture of the material to be learnt.

**Field.independant**: Can differentiate between details, grabs information in concrete concepts, categories. Does not require precise instruction. Likes to learn and work individually.

## MBTI

MBTI concentrates on preferences to focus attention, to absrob and process information, to prioritise and decision making, and in style of living and woriking.

</figure>

**Extrovert**: they need integration of help and instruction, especially in case of individual work, which is very difficult for them.

**Introvert**: Can express themselves better through written text, they like to learn alone.

**Sensitive**: They are more sensitive to the concrete phenomena, very practical, perform very well in routine tasks, but in more complicated tasks they could be distracted by the parts and are not able to think in ling terms.

**Intuitive**: They are able to make connections with previously stored information, associate well and have great imagination.

**Thinking**: Logical reasoning, they make conclusions from basic concepts, they make objective critical analysis.

**Feeling**: insticts, they judge their environment subjectively, depending on whether they like it or not.

**Judging**: They like to make decisions and plan a lot of details before doing any concrete activities. They like to know about deadlines, and the farer the deadline they work more eddectively.

**Perceiving**: leave critical questions.

## Forum

* It's important for teacher to know the possible different learning styles (not only multiple intelligences, but also other learning styles /Kolb, Gregorc .../), so he can make different opportunies for everyone to learn. If teacher didn't know other learning styles/taxonomies, he could always work the same way, in the worst case always the way he thinks it's the best (according to his learning style), for example always taking care to present information visually, but forgetting other styles. Or he could always care about multiple intelligences, but forget the ways students learn according to Kolb. I think it's the best to always have options for children to choose from.

* As it is said in the UNESCO book: the digital storytelling refers to the art of telling stories with a variety of digital multimedia (images, audio, video). It can be used for different parts of learning (as motivation, for presenting new content, for practicing or production ... and for different learning styles, as it includes picture (visual learners), music (musical intelligence), writing/reading (linguistic intelligence). Making a story would be also great for a kinestetic learners. They can make books/stories collaboratively (interpersonal intelligence) or independently (intrapersonal intelligence). They can share them and peer review and learn from each other (interpersonal intelligence). I think that digital storytelling tools make possible for students to be very creative in the way, that can't be without the technology. Making their own story shows their perception and their understanding of the learning content.

* Marta Turcsanyi-Szabo: "It is important to recognise the different needs and strategies not just to suit, but also challenge learners in different ways.
Even though highly debated, awareness on different approacher in LS literature might just encourage teachers (and eLearning providers) to think about options offered within activities."

* Iris A Molina Mutiz: "I do agree with the comments of /.../ others regarding the idea that it depends on needs, strategies, differences, and something out of our own knowledge and competence. There are many theories about how we learn but the last word has not been said yet . However, I do believe that all the theorists are right but we, as  teachers, knowing our own students, should be able to  try different activities that might work well with different type of learner. THIS is a HARD task because most of the time we don't have the time to make that  exhaustive analysis of who is who and how every individual student learns."
