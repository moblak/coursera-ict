# 3.4.1 Designing activities

Importance of proper planning of learning activities when planning to use ICT.



# 3.4.2 Look at some case-studies: Samsung Smart School

[7 videos from Hungary in Samsung Smart School](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLlOmfE91494l5omW1S03PsqCHv2jNPNF).

Project expected teachers to design lessons beforehand.

Some teachers weren't the best in technology use, but they all were very motivated for project to success.

Teachers had a month of preparation to make sure their lessons are OK for learning. They were also peer reviewed!

## PEdagogies encounered

* Filed trip
* guided instructions
* group work, sharing
* game based learning (quiz type: Who wants to be a millionaire)
* simulation
* individualization, personalization

## Different Learning Types

* acquisition
* production
* collaboration
* practice
* discussion

## Tools

* LMS EDU2.0 was chosen as an universal platform: learning resources, communication, organisation of school work; accessible from any device; there was a knowledge base
* tablets
* Maps Street View
* GPS
* blog (each student has his own blog)
* argumented reality applications
* touch television/interactive white board
* PowerPoint
* interactive poster
* listenint to musical version of the poems
* QR-kode
* films - students sinhronize them :)

## Depth of learning in relation to levels of Bloom's Taxonomy
It was the plan in the beginning that it would be used.

* Remembering: new words
* Understanding: quiz
* Applying: 
* Analyzing
* Evaluating: presentation
* Creating: presentations

## The integration of 21st Century skills

* navigation
* searching for information
* digital literacy
* critical thinking
* presentations
* collaboration
* creativity

## Connections between course themes

* geography and astronomy
* english and geography

## The extension of learning space beyond the individual school tables
* filed trip (geography, english)

## Confidence developed in both the teachers and the students
Just after 3 months of using tablets.

Students were very confident, some even as natural ICT users.

Below is just about everything you'll need to style in the theme. Check the source code to see the many embedded elements within paragraphs.

## Ideas

* "Who wants to be a millionaire" type of test
* learn English by presenting their own home time (before they can practice on virtual world: Google Street Vies)
* sinchronisation :)

# 3.4.2 Look at some case-studies: UNESCO: Technology and Pedagogy
[Chapter 3.](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/ictinprimary/unesco_book/Chapter_3_Technology_and_pedagogy.pdf)

"We wanted to know 

* how technology is integrated into the teaching and learning processes, 
* how it is used to support the meeting of curriculum objectives and skills development, 
* how teachers use it for preparing and conducting teaching and learning activities, 
* how ICT can help teachers support the development of various learning styles, 
* and how the assessment methods are being transformed in the context of new technologies"

## 1. Integration of ICT into the teaching and learning proces

"It is important for teachers to understand the educational, didactic, cultural and social issues of using ICT. . ICTs are not, of themselves, generators of innovative educational change. They serve the behaviourist, cognitivist and constructivist approaches equally well, and they are conducive to individualistic confinement as well as to more cooperative forms of teaching. The nature and quality of teaching and learning will therefore depend on the epistemological orientations to structure ICT use (Aubé, 1996)."

It's clear from the study that an appropriate use of ICT contributes to the development of cross-curricular and subject-specific competencies. Students develpš attitudes such a sense of responsibility, pride in work well done, discipline and rigor, ability to organize activities and persevere in them, creativity in action; pupils enjoy the pleasure of work well done (Quebec MELS, 2001). (2)

Impact of the integration of ICT into the teaching and learning:

* teaching styles (major impact): more personalized, differentiated, customized pedagogical approaches to cater different learning styles (VAKOG) or special needs. ICT enablec teachers to create their own digital teaching materials, which is used to personalize teaching and learning. (2-3)
* variety of learning activities (major impact) (2)
* interactive whiteboards: "The generalized dissemination of interactive whiteboards often connected to individual mobile devices is also an important element for increased interactive teaching (use as a presentation tool increasing clearness, accessing knowledge, interactive games with pupils, and interacting with concrete and virtual objects, for curricular topics that involve operational thinking)."
* "Project-based teaching takes an increasingly important part of the activities in the classroom or informal education."
* assessment, evaluation: "ICT provide new opportunities for 
testing knowledge and skills (e.g. new style of evaluation based on e-diaries), or automatic nominative feedback sent to the teacher from a pupil’s tablets when an activity is completed." Students have an option to show their understanding in different ways.

All topics are affected by the integration of ICT. "We saw many cross-curricular projects involving teamwork, investigation, inquiry and exploration, as well as internationally networked 
projects using Skype conferences] or developing different skills [spatial skills, orientation (up, down, left, right), hand-writing skills, autonomous development and independent study, reading, critical thinking, academic writing, note-taking, reference management, time and task management, decision making, planning. (3)

### New ideas
* učitelj razloži učencem, kaj in kako morajo narediti (pokaže). Če so pozorno poslušali, bi morali vedeti, kaj naj naredijo. Če morajo kaj spet vprašati učitelja, jih ta za nepozorno poslušanje kaznuje z dodatno nalogo.
* Imena datotek so vedno: priimek-ime-aktivnost
* jasna pravila

### Unesco's 21st century skills
* critical thinking, 
* creativity, 
* teamwork, 
* cross-cultural understanding, 
* communication, 
* self-direction, 
* technology. (5)

## 2. Meeting curriculum objectives and skills development

- to uderstand how different learning activities can contribute to the depth of learning

"Only in some cases do children receive direct instruction on how to use the equipment or software in lessons aimed explicitly at the development of transferable technical skills"

"Most governmental and schools’ policies (e.g. Quebec MELS, 2001) highlight the increased pressure of integrating new technologies into the working environment and the importance of providing pupils with ICT qualifications. However, the capabilities of ICT are also used to support education in the curriculum, taking for granted either that students are already skilled ‘digital natives’, or that modern interfaces and applications provide enough information and only need minimal preparation. It seems to be generally assumed that the needed skills will develop automatically while practicing curriculum content- related activities (e.g. children research a history topic on the Internet, children use the computer to analyse data in the context of an activity in science, children edit a text to improve it)."

* **Curriculum related ICT activities**: the study shows much evidence for ICTs fulfilling different curriculum objectives in different subjects.
*  **Computational thinking skills development**: the only place where we found evidence of specific ICT skills being actually taught, are ICT-as-a-subject classes in which the major skills targeted include data handling and processing, online advanced research skills, e-safety, presentation techniques, creating podcasts, video editing and audio recording, and graphic design. (7)
* **Cross-curricular skills development**: the impact of ICT integration on other types of high-level, cross-curricular competencies. In most countries, we notice an explicit emphasis on ICT-based projects as a way to boost creativity, critical thinking, problem-solving, learning-to-learn and co-operative ability. /.../ As for the learning-to-learn dimension, some schools are attracted by the potential of ICT to provide the learners with accessible, real time feedback on their performances, or to deploy large-scale delivery of tests and scoring proce- dures, or online multiple choice tests in a variety of subject domains. 
* **Technology as a communication tool** is widespread, be it with blogs, email, Skype sessions with other schools, quad-blogging, or through shared documents. /.../ [T]hey provide opportunities for students to be part of broader communities; to support participation in online collaborative projects; make learning activities and feedback available online anywhere/anytime; to support peer-to-peer as well as students-experts sharing; and increase parent access to student work.
* **Citizenship, personal and social responsibility** is achieved through multiple, interconnected, transversal learning approaches, such as civic education, human rights education, intercultural education, education for peace, global education and media education, using visual, audio, and independent study approaches. 
* **Generic digital literacy skills** are most frequently encountered in project work, where children create reports, animations, video, charts, creates the context and opportunity to use and learn about different communication channels, and the specific skills involved (e.g. students developing a payroll on a spread- sheet and then merging this information into a word processor document for the receipt). Often students are even on a higher level in digital literacy than their teachers; they navigate and correct their mistakes sometimes in the course of the class. Processing a topic in class often involves activities where students are supposed to develop digital representations by themselves as homework, by which both their skills with individual knowledge acquisition and digital literacy is developed. They also learn about the importance of the form of communication (letter, email, social networks).

## 3. Planning and preparing activities with ICT

### Organising ICT-based activities

"In general, ICT is equally used for whole class work, group-based learning as well as individual self-directed learning activities, depending on the objectives and the type of activity, and the problem to be solved. Beyond the class itself, ICT clubs are also popular, as an afterschool activity involving teaching staff as well as parents, as a way to strengthen community engagement. In all cases, there is generally more emphasis on student’s activity even in the context of whole class work.

In a **whole class organization** of the work, ICT is used to present new material from the Internet (e.g. Open Educational Resources), publishers, or created by teachers or the students themselves. It can be an opportunity to increase motivation, generalize a lesson or develop computer literacy skills. This type of ICT activity may take place in the class itself, a computer lab, or even anywhere in the school or at home when using mobile technology.  

In **group work**, small groups are given access to computers, and handle a part of a task, after which groups get together and share their productions and ideas on how to solve the problem, or build a model. During group work, responsibilities and tasks are distributed according to the talents, skills, and inclinations of each pupil, giving each an opportunity to learn from the others. (12)

For **individual work (or pairs)**, a special task is assigned to a given student either for reinforcement or as an individual assignment. It is clear from our study that ICT is perceived worldwide as a perfect mean to individualize and differentiate the educational activities when more able students prepare tasks, presentations of new material and do additional more complicated tasks. And vice versa – weaker students are provided with easier tasks according to their abilities, which they do by themselves or under the supervision of a teacher’s assistant. (12-13)

/.../

Teachers usually select the learning objective and choose the best activity for the children that will also suit their age and needs. Differentiated activities are planned, ensuring that expected learning is accessible to all. Teachers will ensure that they have a strong grasp of what needs to be taught and how to use it and also the expected results and criteria of evaluation have to be foreseen."

#### Highlights

* "To achieve success it is important to formulate the theme of the lesson, to show what the students are going to learn. Also, it is important to have clear and real goals and objectives. During the introductory part of the lesson it is very important to motivate students, and during the main part of the lesson active work of the learners is of great importance. While generalising the lesson it is necessary to ponder the educational process, provide and get back the return reference, evaluate and organize self-evaluation. Creating good physical and psychological learning, and teaching environment, is of great importance as well. When ICT is used in the lessons it is important to foresee what technical means is going to be used, in which part of the lesson it will be used and what goals are expected. It is necessary to co-ordinate more with the ICT maintenance specialist to make sure that the equipment will be in proper technical condition and ready for the students to use. Also, it is important to choose the most appropriate digital content. The teacher has to look carefully through the available digital educational means and select the ones that are the most current and relevant. One more important aspect is that the pupils have to use digital means purposefully and rationally and the standards of hygiene as well as health of students are of great importance.

### The use of ICT in real world problem solving
Activities: networking capacity, data collection, analysis, simulation capcacity. social dimensions.

#### Highlights

## 4. Personalisation, scope and assessment

### The role of children in integrating ICT
"It is clear from our study that ICTs, when used in a proper way, have a major impact on independent learning and the development of autonomy, contributing to shift from a ‘Teaching & Learning’ philosophy to a more ‘Learning & Teaching ’ one." (19)

"In general, pupils are happy to use ICT tools, they know how to use them and are motivated in their learning tasks. In the process of using ICT pupils learn and teach their friends, create digital educational content, communicate and co-operate (do tasks in pairs and in larger groups, present their work), convey their experience to friends and family members (outside the school), evaluate and assess themselves and even contribute to the improvement of digital content." (19) 

#### ICT to support personalised learning
Personalitation is gappening using pedagogical tools and methods.

#### Redcording and reporting on students' use of ICT and assessing ICT-based activities
Schools store pupils' work on their infrastructure. It can be accessible only by parents, only by school (teachers, parents, pupils) or can be shown off publicly.

"The usual trend seen in our examples shows that students are not directly assessed in ICT-based activities unless ICT or rather Informatics is a dedicated subject in the curriculum. Otherwise, teachers would provide extra praise for students using ICT tools in their solutions for assignments and might raise the given grade for the extra work emerging in the resulting submission."

#### Scope of utilization of ICT inside the classroom, outside the classroom, beyond borders
Mainly: inside clasrrom.
Beyond the classroom walls:
* Using digital cameras, navigation system, and camcorders to record events and collect data. 
* Present schoolwork to public, parents or at different conferences. 
* Videoconferencing with partner school through Skype and other social media, sharing information. 
* The digital versions of textbooks provided by publisher using the unique codes on the website allow children to access the same materials at home as in class. 

# 3.4.3 How can leadership and policy support these activities

Chapter 5: National approachers to ICT in education [(UNESCO: ICT in Primary Education, Volume 1)](http://iite.unesco.org/pics/publications/en/files/3214707.pdf)

"Most countries have now developed a strategic approach to ICT in education. In this chapter we set out the principles that are common to some of these documents, and identify the most interesting approaches to fostering the use of ICT in primary education."

Documents are from 2005! > this chapter documents the important steps taken by national governments to promote ICT in education - a menijo, da bi lahko bilo še bolje.

"y have had to be updated when technologies with new capabilities arrived. Not all countries are at the same stage of development of their ICT infrastructure /.../. However, although some countries may be further ahead than others in the process of ICT development, there is a remarkable similarity between the trajectories of change across all countries, whatever their stage of development. Aspiration follows where technological capacity leads. Change in education is primarily technology-led, therefore. We change what the technology suggests can be changed most easily; we do not necessarily harness new technologies to solve our most challenging educational problems."

"Digital technology has transformed many professions in the public and private sectors. It has changed all sectors of education, in many countries. It has not yet transformed education. If we are to optimise the use of ICT in education it means showing who is master, recognising what the technology can do and harnessing it to the needs of education, not merely following where it leads. Interestingly, several national documents now reflect this idea: Harnessing technology: Transforming learning and children’s services (UK, 2005)" (67)

## 1. Common principles in national documents
"The information reported here has been collected from national government websites, and we have selected a representative sample from all parts of the world. Three sources of information have been particularly useful: the World Bank “Master list of ICT/education policy documents”36 dated April 2011, the EU Schools Network report37, and the Survey of ICT and Education in Africa38."

"This section summarises the information extracted from each document in terms of (i) the agencies involved in development and delivery of the approach to ICT; (ii) the government-driven initiatives deployed to promote change; (iii) the approach to ICT in the curriculum; (iv) the digital tools, resources and services made available to education; and (v) the approach to teacher development with respect to the use of ICT for teaching and learning39. We have not included a section on “vision”, or aims for ICT in education (although some of these are quoted in Section 5.3), because the overall aims are so similar across all nations. They can be summarised as: 
>to optimise the use of ICT in order to improve the quality, effectiveness, and accessibility of education in all sectors for the benefit of individuals and society. 

Similarly, there is no section on developing ICT infrastructure as this is a universal concern whatever stage of national development has been reached. In several countries there is now good provision in all primary schools, and in some (e.g. Singapore, Hong Kong) there is near-universal access at home as well. The increasing penetration of home access and mobile technology is beginning to shift government attention away from the provision of personal hardware in schools (e.g. the goal of low pupil-computer ratios) and towards provision of ICT services for home-based learning. It follows that governments will then have the responsibility for minimising the “digital divide” experienced in the homes of students of low-income families. This issue has not yet appeared in the current national documents. On the other hand, for those countries where the penetration of ICT into schools and homes is at an early stage, the provision of school-based technology infrastructure is a priority." (68)

### The agencies involved
"The agencies involved in a government’s development and delivery of ICT are primarily the Ministry of Education, or its equivalent, with public sector education-oriented agencies operating at national and local levels. An interesting approach in Hong Kong is to designate schools that are successful in integrating ICT as “Centres of Excellence”." (69)

### Government-driven initieatives
"The agencies involved in a government’s development and delivery of ICT are primarily the Ministry of Education, or its equivalent, with public sector education-oriented agencies operating at national and local levels. An interesting approach in Hong Kong is to designate schools that are successful in integrating ICT as “Centres of Excellence”." (69)

### ICT in the curriculum
"ICT in the curriculum takes three forms or models of implementation, as specified in section 2.4: (i) ICT integrated across curriculum, (ii) ICT as a distinct curriculum subject, and (iii) Informatics (or Computer Science, Computing etc.) as a distinct curriculum subject. “ICT skills” often tends to focus on the use of standard applications rather than programming, which can diminish the potential value of ICT as a subject – young people are not receiving the stimulus and support that will interest them in careers that innovate and develop the digital tools and services of the future. Furthermore, a focus on programming and modelling skills is far more relevant to 21st century employment needs. ICT embedded within other topics typically exploits applications and access to Internet resources that are subject-specific. Digital literacy focuses more on the 21st century technology-related skills and competencies that all graduates will need, including the use of technology to assist with high level cognitive skills such as problem-solving, information analysis, design, etc.

National approaches to ICT in the curriculum, as for any change to the curriculum, are typically the responsibility of government, so this is addressed in all of the documents in our sample. A national curriculum approach may focus on the needs of the information society, as in Eritrea and India, but will also embed ICT across the curriculum, as in France, Hong Kong, Kenya, Norway, Russian Federation, Singapore, USA and UK, with most of these explicitly including the primary curriculum." (70)

### Teacher development
"Teacher development focuses primarily on equipping teachers with basic ICT literacy, although some countries want teachers to be able to integrate ICT into their pedagogy themselves, rather than rely on directives or pre-designed resources from others. In this case there is an intention to provide teachers with a deeper understanding of what ICT can do in education and to provide the knowledge building and sharing systems for teachers that will make them more knowledgeable consumers, and more skilled at making the best of available tools and resources (Australia, France, Hong Kong). A focus on teacher collaboration to foster the optimal use of ICT is a welcome approach given the complexity of what they have to develop. The curriculum for initial teacher training now often incorporates reference to ICT literacy, and where there is an emphasis on the importance of ICT in all curriculum subjects there is naturally a focus on this in the training. However, the teacher-training curriculum is not typically developed or taught by people whose main expertise lies in ICT-related pedagogies, because there has been so little time for such experts to develop. It is more likely that the personal development of this understanding will come through professional development rather than initial training, at least for some years. This is why countries that are leading the way, such as Singapore, the US and UK, are seeking to develop a “community of practice”, a cadre of teachers with strong pedagogical grounding working as specialist teachers in schools to lead effective integration of ICT into the classroom and the curriculum."

"A teacher-led development of knowledge about how to optimise the use of ICT in the primary classroom would be valuable, alongside research-based studies. It has the important additional advantage that the knowledge and principles of practice are owned by the teaching community, and close to the point of use where they will have an immediate effect, rather than being disseminated top-down. However, there is little focus in any of the documents reviewed on providing teachers with the time to develop and innovate with ICT. Along with lack of training, lack of time is a frequent problem." (71)

### General points
"Most national documents make no commitment to funding, and in many cases do not assign specific roles or responsibilities to organisations or units to put the ICT plans into action. In some countries it is possible to identify evaluation reports on previous plans, but there is often no specific programme for evaluation of the implementation. The extent to which these plans have borne fruit is hard to assess, therefore. What we can conclude reliably is that there is a clear intention, for a wide range of governments, to establish ICT as a critical part of the programme to improve and update primary education." (71)

## 2. Harnessing technology to the needs of education
- what is needed for ICT to be effective?
- test current national approaches against that

"The overarching aim that unites most national documents is to optimise the use of ICT to improve the quality, effectiveness, and accessibility of education. Improving quality means enhancing the range of learning activities available to children to engage them in new forms of interaction , communicating, designing, and making, that the full range of ICT tools offers.

There is a strong desire in many countries to help all learners achieve their maximum learning potential. However, this is still a long way from being fulfilled, as the disparity between countries in the international educational benchmarks shows. ICT is seen as a way of enabling all learners to be given the kind of personalised support, and engaging forms of learning, that would make this feasible. At the broadest interpretation of accessibility this will include the UNESCO “Education for All” Goal and, for the countries in this survey that already have universal primary schooling, it includes access to better education for children who are disabled, or travelling, or for other reasons unable to attend regular schools." (72)

### Policy requirements
3 requirements identified for policy and leadership:

* student ICT competency
* competency standards for teachers and students
* new models of assessment

1 and 2 are addressed in national documents, 3 not. "Formal assessment methods have to change to accommodate the new digital capabilities that students are learning, and it is now possible to assess learning through performance-based methods such as student portfolios, project- based learning, and activities that use ICT in a way that emulates real-world work, as in the publication from Eritrea." (72)

"Schools and students both focus on the requirements of the assessment system because this is the way they are judged, so ICT will only be seen as important if the assessment system uses ICT skills to evaluate learning (Tan, 2011). However, the references to assessment are typically to ensure that basic ICT competencies are assessed, which is not the same as assessing the ability to use ICT to learn, and to demonstrate what has been learned. This is like assessing the ability 
to write rather than using writing to assess what has been learned. The focus should be on assessing what is important to measure, and making greater use of ICT to improve formative assessment and the use of digital data about learning performance, that can offer teachers a better understanding of what each student needs (cf. USA document)." (72-73)

### School-based requirements
"The recommendations in Chapter 3 for what schools need to do for working with ICT include elements that can be encouraged by national policy, but must be implemented at school level: namely, development of an ICT policy plan, leadership from headteachers, access to ICT facilities and trained staff, evaluation of ICT integration practices, and cooperation with other schools. Critical to a national policy plan are the expectation for teachers to collaborate on innovation through a shared vision across the school community, with teachers learning and sharing their ideas, and with incentives to encourage innovative practices (Lim, 2007)."

"[S]tudies have shown that without additional time and a link to personal reward, it is difficult to change teacher behaviour for any form of educational innovation (Dowker, 2003; Dowker, 2009; Griffin, 2004)." > ampak tega ni v dokumentih, čeprav je zelo pomembno.

### Curriculum requirements
Learning through using ICT = e-learning = technologi-enhanced learning

It's important to distinguish the idea of *learning through using ICT in a range of curriculum topics*, from learning *how to use ICT in different areas* (digital literacy); "which is seen as a core competence applicable to everything teachers and learners do." (73)

V mnogih dokumentih ni jasne ločnice med tema dvema. (73)

"In the context of 21st century curriculum, “key skills” and competencies, policies often present the strategic aim of national economic growth as a driver for equipping all citizens and school leavers with the capability to understand and make good use of the many ways in which digital technologies can improve work, education, domestic life and leisure time. That in turn drives educational ICT policies towards equipping schools with infrastructure, tools and resources 
they need to be able to teach digital literacy as a new skill. However, digital literacy is still is an ill-defined competence, as teachers and leaders realise that it should cover more than simply an ability to use basic IT tools and websites. Its real value is when the individual can identify novel ways of using and applying each new digital innovation, without having to rely on being shown what to do. The field moves too fast for education to teach everyone everything, hence the shift in focus from *ICT skills to digital literacy*." (73-74)

"Learning through ICT, or e-learning, or technology-enhanced learning, puts the focus on using technology to solve the difficult problems in education: learning difficult concepts and skills, or learning in a challenging context, or reaching the most challenging learners. Here the role that technology plays in the curriculum is pedagogic or logistical – changing the pedagogy to enable learners to learn in a more active, more collaborative or more engaging way, and changing the mode of learning to a more flexible (potentially online) delivery. Using technology to improve the quality and reach of education, or improve attainment levels, or increase attendance and access, means that teachers and education leaders must be able to use the digital tools and resources that they have in new and imaginative ways to help learners achieve what is impossible without the use of technology. This could be simulations of climate change, or space exploration, or running a shop, or writing a play – at primary level these activities can transform the kinds of learning activities that are possible, as Chapter 6 shows. These new ways of teaching demand a teaching community that is confident with technology, and able to innovate and learn from each other. That is why we have also focused on plans for teacher development, as that will drive the innovation and effectiveness of e-learning across the curriculum." (74)

### Factors affecting implementation

"As we consider what it takes for new technology to make a significant improvement to primary education it is important to be aware of the very strong drivers that already exist in educational systems, and which have not been developed with respect to these new opportunities. Perhaps the most powerful are curriculum requirements, assessment, quality assurance mechanisms, and the way funding flows to different school activities. Learner needs will also be a high priority. These are issues that teachers and school leaders focus on every day, in the way a primary school is run. There are also pressures from “stakeholders”, such as parents, school governors, and local administrators. And individual teachers will be aware of their own career opportunities as a motivator for their work. ICT is thus a minor element in the whole system by comparison with all these powerful drivers. 

While drivers prioritise activities, teachers and leaders may be able to shape activities for themselves, and ICT can provide the capacity to do this. In practice, ICT impacts most clearly on teachers’ and leaders’ activities as a set of enablers to support their work to improve the quality of the learning experience, and their learners’ achievements. Figure 5.2 sets out the main ways in which ICT enablers can improve the activities that are prioritised in the education system by the main drivers we have discussed." (74)

  <figcaption><a href="http://iite.unesco.org/publications/3214707/">Factors affecting implementation</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

"The ICT-related enablers in Figure 5.2 are important precisely because the curriculum, assessment, quality standards, and funding imperatives are difficult for schools to change in response to ICT opportunities. Being embedded in educational systems and sectors, these key drivers are determined and revised by agencies, departments, and professionals that may not have any direct requirement to adapt to the continually changing opportunities offered by ICT. Thus, government initiatives are critical for leading this type of change. But also, the other forms of initiative discussed in section 5.2, putting in place enablers such as communities of practice, training and development, the ability to share resources, etc., make it possible for teachers and leaders in primary schools to effect some changes from the ground up. Both top-down and bottom-up enablers play their part in the holistic systemic change that is needed if the use of ICT is to fulfil its potential." (74-75)

## 3. Quotes from the national documents
"[T]hey have in common an expectation of the value of ICT in primary education, a sense of the importance of developing their own local content in addition to accessing international resources, and a clear understanding of the importance of engaging parents and teachers in the development of the optimal ICT-based learning experiences." (76)

### The expected value of ICT in primary education
high expectations of its value (personal benedit to the individual + economic benefit to the country)

### Local contetnt development
"The international availability of open educational resources allows schools in all countries to access educational software and resources as a starting point for their teaching and learning. However, being entirely dependent on educational content that is created elsewhere would not be desirable, as it is important for the primary curriculum to be close to the local culture and priorities. This motivation to develop home-grown materials as well is apparent in many countries". (76)

### Parental engagement

"A learner’s experience of primary education takes place in the contexts of both school and home. Some national plans for the use of ICT therefore place considerable importance on the role of parents. A school that communicates effectively with the home provides a greatly enriched learning environment, because it can support parents and carers in supporting their children’s development, in a coherent way with the school’s programme. Online communication makes this feasible, but only if the parents have the basic ICT skills that allow them to engage with the online school system". (77)

### Teacher engagement
Crucial.

## 4. Concluding point
"Our selection of national approaches to ICT in primary education has shown that across the globe, all governments have recognised the importance and value of digital technologies in education." (ni pa vedno jasen fokus na osnovno izobraževanje)

"Children are often able to learn to use new technologies more readily than adults; they need active, creative, and collaborative learning tasks to be able to learn effectively, and ICT provides all these opportunities. Because of this, even in countries where the infrastructure is slow to develop there is still a plan to extend ICT provision to the primary sector as soon as possible."

"The UNESCO Education for All Goal is a major global educational challenge. Digital technologies are good at solving hard problems on the large scale. If teacher development were to focus on digital literacy and collaborative development of innovative online pedagogies there could be a profound acceleration towards this goal. However, this requires funding resource to be directed at teachers, and it is actually more often diverted to hardware, software, and connectivity – which are essential, but technology does not need to be “high end” to be effective. National approaches feature insufficient teacher development, as we showed in section 5.1: the distribution of funding resource between human capacity and technical capacity always favours the latter. Teachers play the principal role in changing how effectively learners learn, and they need much better support to be able to harness technology to this end.

It is rare for any national ICT strategy to clarify the funding to be invested in this critical strategic change for education, and although agencies and organisations are identified as having a role in implementation, there is no national policy that identifies what that role should be, what milestones they are to work to, or by when they are to deliver. The [“ICT in Education Toolkit’](http://www.ictinedtoolkit.org/usere/login.php), (Information for Development Program)40 recommends that policies for primary schools should be organised around the need to: 

* Formulate and Assess ICT-Enhanced programs; 
* Plan for Physical and Human Requirements; 
* Plan for ICT-Enhanced Content;
* Generate Programme Costs; 
* Create a Master Plan; 
* Monitor Implementation, Effectiveness, and Impact."

# 3.4.3 Leadership and policy support for ICT activites' Forum
* Maria Gairy: " I think this is one of the most crucial elements to determine the level of ICT in any institution. If the leaders are enthusiastic about it, they will more likely ensure that the necessary policies and hardware be put in place so that teachers can take up the challenge without feeling overly challenged!"
* Me: "I agree with you too. The UNESCO's document really shows how the policy should be made in practice and what are the most important issues. Having such a support, as recommended in the document, from leadership and the Ministry of Education would be very helpful for innovative teachers and for learning to move from teacher-centred to student-centred teaching and learning with ICT. But I think there is always the problem with the financial situation. Appropriate infrastructure is quite expensive and if the use of ICT is recommended in the national policy, there should be money for IT-infrastructure, teachers' development ... too."

# 3.4.4 Create your own Learning Object
> Create a Learning Object using ICT that would suit your interest and profile in your Course Journal, explaining how it relates to learning outcomes and curricular requirements within your locality. 

## Title (a name for your learning object)

## Context (the intended age group or curriculum level)

## Intedned learning outcome (making reference to Bloom's taxonomy, and your local curriculum rewuirements)

## Outline of the activities and resources used - including the ICT tool or resource being used

## An outline of the assessment rubric used /notes from activity 3.5.3/
