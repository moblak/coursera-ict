# ICT in primary education reactions
Positive words about children learning and creating with tablet computers: fun, engagement, learning, digital literacy.

Negative words about children learning and creating with tablet computers: time-consuming

My reactions are typical. I agree with all the words in wordcloud, there are some I haven't think much of them, such as a price (expensive), distraction (but I don't see much problem here, I believe that if the lesson is well prepared, children would have no time for being distracted /and no wish too/ and parents /it's a problem if they do not agree with this kind of learning).

Learning with ICT brings new opportunities for learning, esspecially in creativity, and digital literacy is very important skill for the 21st century. But - we all went to school where technology wasn't used much/at all, but we all learned to use it. Maybe the technology is not that intuitive for us than it's for kids, but it's the same with everything new, not just technology. Children are explorers and they are not afraid to broke anything, they are not as critical as we are.

I agree that lessons with ICT should be fun, creative, collaborative, engaging, interactive, innovative and motivating. It's time consuming, that's true (but not allways - for example if students write an essay for slovenian language lesson, it can be easyly improved in word, but if they write on paper, they have to write everything again from the beginning - so sometimes working without technology is time consuming too). We should also present the positive and negative aspect of using technology to parents, so they know why ICT is used and that it's used critically and when it's best for their children's learning. The price I think is the biggest problem, but I think that for the price parents pay for paper texbook and other things needed for school and some support from the government it shouldn't be the problem to buy some device. It doesn't have to be the best technology, but it has to be of a good quality (screen resolution is very important if students use tablets for learning). I think students should have tablets (with seperate keyboards that can borrow in school), not PCs, because they are more mobile, the battery remains longer, they have touch screens ... You can also have this on laptops, but they are more expencive than tablets. 

Anyway, I don't agree with BYOD policy. It's easyer to work in the classroom if students have the same devices. The main problem is see in BYOD policy is that some children would bring the newest and most expensive devices, but others would have old devices. It would bring pressure on them and their parents to buy newest and better devices. In England, I heard, there is a policy that the government gives students/teachers some amount of virtual-money to buy harware/software/learning content from approved companies. I think it's a great idea.

Of course the optimal condition is 1:1 access: it makes differentiation and individualization easyer (children are more creative, they learn at their own pace) ... When they work collaboratively, they work on one device in the cloud, so everyone can reach the task on his own device.

I don't think that distraction is a big problem. With interesting and important task (solving real world problems) and inner motivation students won't have a time to be distracted. It's important that they have just the right amount of the time. If they have their task to be completed, they will not have time to do anything else. But if they would do different things, they will have to finish their task in their free time.

SInce the cost of the devices is the problem the schools maybe should start with the mobile units - teacher can borrow devices for his lesson. But here is still the main problem: to use ICT effectivelly, it has to be used as normal part of the lessons, not something new and occassional. It's hard to expect children to work on their e-portfolios if they don't always have their mobile device with them to make notes, photos, videos ...

# Quiz "Your educational context"

What are the main reasons for thinking ICT should or should not be used in primary education? My opinion last week (chapter 2):

Why it should:

1. Internal
   1. motivation
   2. students' activity
   3. solving real world's problems
   4. better results
   5. better communication (extended opportunities)

2. External
   1. information society
   2. better results for school

3. Ecucational
   1. solving real world's problems
   2. better results
   3. digital literacy
   4. information literacy
   5. critical thinking
   6. individualization
   7. differentiation
   8. clearness
   9. creativity
   10. better learning experience
 
 Why it shouldn't:

1. Internal
   1. interpersonal relations (f2f)
  
2. External
   1. if teachers don't know how to use ICT properly
   2. if there is no proper ICT infrastructure
   3. if e-learning material is badly prepared
   4. if children don't want to work with technology (is that even possible?)

3. Educational
   1. handwriting, working/learning with paper.
   2. time consuming

## Supporting teachers and leaders
On padlet we wrote what we think about the process of integrating IT into primary education - what do the teachers adn leaders need, what would help them most.

I love this course, thank you for making it! It's great to be part of such wonderful community - I've got so many brilliant ideas and aspect on the ICT in education. Thanks also to our amazing instructor, Diana. I've applied to many MOOC's before, but no one like this. I really enjoy it and I really learn a lot.
And this is also the first time for me to use padlet, it's really nice tool!
Here is my view on teachers and ICT. I believe that teacher is the most important in the process of integrating ICT in schools. Without the teacher, who knows how to use ICT properly for achieving learning goals, the use of ICT is useless. Here is my list of priorities for teachers' and leaders' as they plan the integration of ICT:

* each teacher should always teach in the same classroom and not move around the school
* government's support, support from the school head, from co-workers and parents
* IT infrastructure for teachers and students: hardware, educational software, VLE or LMS, 1:1 classroom
* smaller classes (20 or less)
* time to innovate 
* computer rooms for children 
* collaboration between teachers in the school and between schools (also internationaly) (collaborative environment)
* pedagogic support (personal development)
* award (pay rise :), more time for innovating ...)

## The new idea I'll try next

* **Digital Library** (in Moodle?). This idea is very interesting, especially for me as a history teacher. Students can bouid their own archive of primary sources on particular topic. WHat is good about the digital library is also that the-following-year-students can use it and extend it. I can also use this idea for slovenian language classes. Students can make their digital library of books - they collect open-source books and the books they write. Can you imagine their excitemen when they finish their short novel or a fairytale, make an e-book an publish it online and make a copy available in the digital library, when everyone can read it?
* Working on making people understant that teachers need more time to innovate to bring ICT in our classrooms (writing articles, blog posts, talking to teachers). We shouldn't be passive here.
* **E-portfolio**. I would like to start with [EU-folio](http://eufolio.eu/): "EUfolio - EU Classroom ePortfolios is a project funded by the European Commission under the framework of the Lifelong Learning Programme (KA1 - Implementation of the European strategic objectives in Education and Training). The aim of the project is to design and test innovative ePortfolio models which will inform and support the implementation of innovative learning environments using ICT across Europe."[source](http://eufolio.eu/about))
* **Blog**. I think that blog is one of the most useful ICT tool for teaching and learning. I would use it as a journal for all my classes, so children could learn from each other not only in one classroom but from all students I teach. That would improve their social skills and confidence. It's important to make students responsible for the blog. Blog can also be used as an e-portfolio. Children can have everything in one place, they develop digital literacy and learn to evaluate their work. I think it's important to make them collaborate, comment on each other's work (to peer review).
* **Student response system**. This is great idea. I have used this tool for my presentation on conference two years ago and got very positive feedback, especially because this tool made the presentation more interesting, they were active and not just listeners. The great thing is that you can show the results immediatelly after the answers are sent. I used QR-codes so they didn't have to type URL's. In Slovenia we have something similar and free to use: [Kliker](http://kliker.sio.si/kliker.html). On the last conference I've been (it was last week) it was used all the time - we could answer lecturer's answers or even ask him questions and he answers at the end. The great thing about this tool is also that you just check in the "room" and there you can answer questions, ask questions, look at the results ... There's no need for QR-codes for each question(aire). There is even better usage for school - at the beginning of each lesson (for example before every history lesson) they can check in in the "room" on Kliker and that's it. Teacher can ask unplanned questions even between lesson.Maybe it is now the same with Poll Everywhere, I'm not sure since I haven't use it for 2 years. Those tools really are amazing and a must in teaching with ICT. BUT!!!: Students need their own devices (1:1).
* **Storybird**. It looks very easy to use and children can be very creative. This is something different than just writing story on a paper, they can even share it with others and illustrate it. The only problem for me as someone who teaches slovenian language is that this application is in English and student don't understand everything. And it shows them that slovenian language is less important than english.
* **Padlet**.
* **Voki**. Oarasjevu Belogia suggests the use of voki. "Voki is a free service that lets you create customized speaking characters. During our first lesson, we can ask students to present themselves (name, age,likes/dislikes, appearance etc) by creating a voki character, but they should not reveal their names.  Their presentations should end with the phrase"Who am I?" When all students have created their characters, the teacher presents each one of them and the class tries to guess who is who." Great idea for the beginning of the year!

# My current plans, questions and ideas
I just want to learn as much as possible.

I will try to make a short abstract for week 1 before I move to week 2.

Any maybe I shoul try writing shorter posts. :)

And I also believe it's time to start an e-educational blog in slovenian language, because i haven't find anything very useful for teachers. I have this in mind for a very long time, but never had time to make it work.

I would like to try Learning Designer and Evernote.
