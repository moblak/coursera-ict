Week 4: TECHNOLOGY OPPORTUNITIES

4.2 CHOOSING THE TECHNOLOGY

Instructor: Ivan Kalas and Ernesto Laval

* Will be replaced with the ToC, excluding the "Contents" header
{:toc}

# 4.2.1 What do other schools do?
"Schools may have different criteria and preferences when choosing new technology to be integrated into their teaching and learning activities."

## Many factors should be respected

### Criteria
* expectations at the school level (shool leader, IT specialist)
* experience and potential of the school
* teaching and learning goals
* safety standards, ergonomic issues, appropriateness ...

</figure>

### Categories of ICT

* from different perspectives
* sofftware/hardware
* purpose
* way of using: inside/outside; individually/collaboratively
* ...

### Actual trends based on UNESCO's observations

* clear tendency to prefer NB and (even more) tablets
* more experienced schools "need more": to build technology-rich learning environment; often advocate one-to-one strategy
* tendency to move to mobile technologies
* implementing BYOD strategy

### Most frequent challenges

* financial issues (most is spent on hardware)
* lack of certain types of software (for creativity)
* high time demands
* urgent need to better equip teachers themselves

### How much technology do we need?

* it depends: how experienced we are; it is possible to start with one computer and one digital camera
* then, when we better understand the potential for learning, we need more - for our students!

### One-to-One approach

* buidling technology-rich environment
* experienced schools aim for 1-1 tablets for at least some of their students, IWBs in every classroom, digital toys, devices to create, explore, express, collaborate

# 4.2.2 Choosing appropriate technology

"In the introductory presentation to Section 4.2 we mentioned the concept of the developmental appropriateness of an ICT tool. Here we look further at the set of criteria for considering whether a tool (software or hardware) is developmentally appropriate or not. These criteria come from the Early Childhood Education context, and are published in the [UNESCO book ‘Recognising the potential of ICT in early childhood education’ (UNESCO IITE 2010)](http://iite.unesco.org/pics/publications/en/files/3214673.pdf). However, we believe that they are equally appropriate to consider for primary education."

## Ivan Kalaš: Recognizing the potential of ICT in early childhood education

### 2.2 What does the literature say about ICT in ECE?
The 2004 report from New Zealand summarizes that, "when used appropriately ICT can be a productive tool for support young children's learning and support. Studies suggest that ICT use can provide a context for collaboraƟon, cooperaƟon, and posiƟve learning experiences between children, or between children and adults.However, this will not necessarily happen of its own accord. Research indicates that practitioners must be conscious of the kinds of learning interacƟons they would like to occur in the context of ICT use (including between adults and children, or between 
children), and adopt pedagogical strategies to support these." (24)

#### Safety concerns

##### Playing computer games

* playing computer games 
* using old monitors, risk to eyesight from projectors (24)
* ICT in ECE encourages children to be passive recipients
* isolation from social integration in learning and play
* deprived of movement, role playing, building things, other active experiences

But report indicate that in real settings computers and other ICT integrate inco ECE learning experiences alongside with many other kinds of activities. "ICT should not be seen as a way of superseding or displacing these kinds of experiences." (25)


##### Teachers' role
To understand all sadery concerns a systemic, in-depth and actual research is required. THe only eddicient way to eliminate/minimize their effect in real settings is to involve a knowledgeable teacher. "It is the teacher‘s responsibility to appraise proper forms of ICT criƟcally 
and employ them to support creaƟve play and expression, not only through the selecƟve and supported use of particular soŌware applicaƟons (including computer games), but also through the use of a range of diﬀerent forms of ICT (for example, digital cameras and other tools for recording and communicating, programmable toys, educational robotics construcƟon sets, or digital microscope, etc.), ... both indoors and outdoors, for a range of different learning and play 
acƟviƟes (New Zealand Council for EducaƟonal Research, 2004: 23)."

##### Developmental appropriateness

* a guiding principle in much of the literature on ICT in ECE > it provides a useful general framework for teachers and decision-makers to develop their skills **in recognizing and applying the most appropriate ICT tools**. This framework - DATEC /*The Developmentally Appropriate Technology in Early Childhoold* project/ - identifies 9 general criteria for determining the appropriateness of the ICT tools to be applied in ECE /early cildhood education/. 
* to be used for a debate of using in particular setting; might be used as a tool to evaluate software programs or other ICT application (25)

##### Abstract
"The value ICT can add to young children’s learning environments depends on the choices pracƟƟoners make about which tools to select, and when and how to use these; and their understandings about how these tools can support children’s learning, development, and play. ... They also need to be familiar with contemporary theories about learning and development, and recognize how these can be linked to the use of ICT." (27)

"Literature moderately explores how ICT can support other aspects of early childhood educaƟon, like planning, diagnosing, assessing and documenƟng ICT and early childhood learning children’s development, administraƟon and information management, sharing and exchanging informaƟon between centres and other insƟtuƟons, etc." (27-28)


## Appropriate ICT tools for primary education (forum)

1. Nur Ali Tejani: 
"* ICT should promote creative thinking, construction (consumer) of knowledge, and develop innovative products 
* ICT should promote the use of digital media to communicate and work collaboratively in order to participate effectively in the society.
* ICT should promote research and information fluency skills where student apply digital tools to gather, analyze, evaluate and use information."

2. Jacqueline Samules:
* "It is probably not so much a difficult task for ICT specialists or teachers to recognize tools that are inappropriate for primary students because of violent content. Where the issue becomes a concern is use of such tools within the context of home and how much parents do regulate use by kids during this phase of their development.  As teachers we would want to believe that parents are responsible enough to monitor the use of these tech tools to ensure those with violent interactions are avoided.  The truth is, it is not always done and this can play over in the school setting.  

Additionally,  what one parent sees as harmless interactions example game based tools which involve guns, another parent would see as totally inappropriate. This particular issue is important to the teacher because at this stage of the child's development negative behaviour can spill over into their interactions with peers."

Answer from Ivan Kalas (instructor): 
"I can only agree with you, Jacqueline. What is often happening in my country, Slovakia, is that as soon as the level of digital literacy of the teachers and the whole school increases, parents start to accept them as their advisers, they start to recognize them as authorities in this area. They come to the teacher and ask her/him what their kid should do with the computer at home, what kind of software is appropriate, where to get exactly the same applications they are using at school... I think that in many countries we are going through the similar process: teachers must be digitally literate because the parents often are not."

> Teachers must be digitally literate because the parents often are not.

3. Connie Bonnici: "ICT tools in the classroom should support creativity of students and provide publishing tools for students to present their creations."

Answer from Ivan Kalas: "This is one of the most important issues, Connie. ICT tools should do that. But what is even more - ICT tools CAN DO THAT, they have incredible potential to help us create opportunities for our kids to be creative, to EXPRESS themselves, to create something - a product - which they find important not only for them, but for others (to show and share with their parents, for example). It is up to us teachers to grasp this potential and use new technology as a new, flexible, and powerful means of creative expression."

4. Bindu Grover: 
"**Differentiation**

Keeping in mind, varied needs of the students, the technological tool should be able to differentiate

* content
* process
* product

This is a great challenge to me as I teach mixed ability students.

**Assessment**

It is important that the tool should offer an assessment focus aligned to learning outcomes."

5. Ivan Kalas (about parent involvement)
"In my experience, there are two most important partners who must support us in the whole process - otherwise we would be lost in our effort: it is the headmaster and the parents. Let us hope that all headmasters of all participants of this course support us. However, what to do with the parents? In our schools, many teachers play "clever tricks" to get parents involved, to make them understand what our learning goals are, what do we use the technology for.

Just one example: one of our collaborating teacher got a digital photo frame. She asked the kids to photo document each activity every day - by themselves. In the afternoon she uploaded the pictures into the photo frame and placed it in the open space when parents come with their children in the morning next day. Kids were excited to show and explain to their parents what they were doing yesterday and what they personally photographed! And all parents loved this strategy and started understand and support the teacher."

Answer from Matthew Kelsey:
Ideas for involving parents:

* YouTube channel where they upload assemblies and [student performances](http://youtu.be/CNIxoA796_M)
* Facebook page where they highlight events and achievements
* news blog
* primary school teachers keep class blogs where they report what's been happening on a day-to-day basis sot hat parents can support learning at home

It's not enought to communicate virtually. 

6. Noelia Rozado Fernandez: "In the document, one idea that is taken into account is that some researchers believe that “ICT in ECE encourages children to be passive recipients, solitary computer game players isolated from social interactions in learning and play, deprived of movement (…)”." but: "Students can play together in small groups and they can exchange their points of view with their classmates, promoting in this way socialization. Furthermore, computer games are also a good tool to develop eye-hand coordination."

Answer: "Computer Games as a Real Friend and Virtual Life

Modern Technology has the capability to bring people together as well as enhance the social abilities of the today’s youth.

The immense capabilities of the Internet today are astonishing, and offer many positive opportunities video games can serve as a central activity for interpersonal interaction, providing an activity for friends to share. Online video gamers, who may appear to others to be playing alone, can interact with others across the game network and establish new friendships. Online gaming can lead to strong ties and to contact partners who serve as possible sources of rewarding interactions like social support.

Gaming has been described as a bedroom culture where isolated children sit in their bedrooms alone and play. This is a fact that people play online with or against others has somewhat changed the view of games as antisocial media. Online gaming is rapidly growing and mmorpg (massive multiplayer online role playing games) can be considered to constitute social spaces where human interaction is important. It has been said that online social spaces e.g. mmorpg’s today are so advanced that they can be viewed as ”a second living space” and that they cannot be separated from “normal” social life. Mmorpg games constitute social spaces where a group, or individuals, takes part in different adventures. The games have inbuilt possibilities for social interaction and these social interactions is the key attraction for gamers to play the games."

## Technology opportunities

*"Read section 2.1 Choosing technology from Chapter 2 'Technology opportunities', of the [UNESCO Book ICT in Primary Education. Volume 2: Policy, Practices and Recommendations](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/ictinprimary/unesco_book/Chapter_2_Technology_opportunities.pdf), which summarizes the responses to our survey about how schools are involved in the process of choosing technology and what kinds of technologies are being acquired and used in the classrooms. Do these responses add anything to the criteria in the book?"*

### 2.1 Choosing technology

#### ICT's are being chosen

* at school level
* at the local level
* at the centralized (governmenta) level

"teachers often state that if the decisions are being taken outside the school, they are ... less respectful of real and individual needs and ... teachers and school staff have limited influence on the selection process. If it is chosen outside school, it usually concerns hardware (as if 
choosing software was less important, less costly... some teachers note). When the selection process takes place at the school level, there are often quite elaborate processes to ensure appropriate decisions – carefully considering its values for teaching and learning, respecting the school ICT strategy..." (2)

#### Most schools respect/consider:

* age of children
* safety standardsa and ergonomics
* possible upgrades of softrware
* ease of use

The selection process often involves achieving support form the Parents Association. (2)

#### What is being chosen

* standard hardware (computers, data projectors, IWBs, notebooks, tablets, scanners, printers, cameras, digital cisualizers, digital microscopes, microphones and MP3 recorders, headsets, smartphones)
* standard software (text processing, tables, presentations, drawing tools, video editors, general or subject oriented educational software, microworlds, applications)
* less frequently: voting devices, video conferencing systems, video studio, video editing software, more complex audio equipment and software ...

#### Final notes

* tendency to move from desktop computers to notebooks, netbooks, tablets, smartphones
* in many schools some of the ICT resources are located (and used by pupils) in the school libraries
* have or want: technology rich environment (IWB in every classroom, each pupil with tablet, enough technology)
* rare: BYOD
* digital technology is supporting mobile learning (3)

#### Highlights

* "... any ICT tool (a) must be compatible with our pedagogy, support exploration, and 
encourage thinking, (b) must be flexible to satisfy different age groups and 
different teaching/learning goals – different age groups share the same premises 
and equipment, so it´s important that the adopted solutions meet the needs of all 
age groups, (c) must support working with different kind of data – text, image, 
music and sound... (d) if possible, should be similar to what children have at home, 
(e) must have reasonable price, or be free and easily available online, if possible... If 
these criteria are satisfied, it is easier to meet the needs of all children."

### 2.2 Integrating LMS

The study reveals that a deeper understanding of the potential of ICT to support learning and development of the pupils manifests in seeking and demanding higher functionality of the supporting ICT, including technical infrastructure and learning management system. Four levels of development can be recognized here: 

1. few schools do not use any LMS and are not aware of its need so far;
2. some schools are still not using any particular system but already practise some of its basic functionality – like simple file-sharing and e-mail communication;
3. some schools have already started using an LMS, mostly for posting homeworks and teaching materials, and for communication with their pupils;
4. many schools are profound users of wide functionality of an LMS. They most often use it: 

   1. For teachers – to post assignments and homework; to manage, spread and share primary and supplementary digital content; to collect the pupils’ work; to support and administer the teaching/learning process (engaging e-portfolios, e-record books, e-diary, grading lists, weblogs, webinars...); to post and share school news and achievements etc. 
   2. For pupils – to help them administer their learning and personal development; to facilitate their cooperation and collaboration in projects; to post their work, solu- tions, and products; to communicate with teachers and with peers etc. Younger pupils often have one common class login; older pupils usually get personal login and password. 
   3. For parents – to observe the learning content and progress of their children; achievement and assessment (e-portfolios); to get into home-school communication etc.

### 2.3 Respecting differencies

"The study shows that most schools and teachers are aware of the importance of respecting the individual needs of their pupils, and to consider these when choosing ICT. They know that digital technology facilitates respecting the differences in learning styles and multiple intelligences. However, some of them admit that current economic factors deprive them from doing so at present... the goal is to get basic technology into classrooms first. 

By selecting a wide range of technologies, schools respect diversity and individual differences: they encourage pupils to manifest their learning through text, music, graphics, audio, or video formats, individually and collaboratively. ... in addition, software is purchased to support pupils’ learning according to their readiness level, whether the pupil is high end, low end, or average. Rich selection of technologies also facilitates multiple... languages and representations. Schools prefer to select technologies, which stimulate attention of the learners, like ... presentations provided with audio support. As we observed, many schools try to verify their instructional styles to meet their pupils’ learning styles and multiple intelligences. They tend to combine video presentations, pictures and diagrams (for visual learners), auditory activities (for aural learners), hands on activities (for physical or kinaesthetic learners), common group work (for social or collaborative learners), and individual assignments (for intrapersonal learners). (8)

Some schools have extensive experience in implementing particular digital technologies (for example tablets) for supporting and motivating differentiated personalised learning for pupils with special needs. Teachers often mention that digital technology can help diminish (growing) gaps among pupils of different needs, giving each of them better chance to find a way, and a format, to express herself or himself. (8-9)

The age appropriateness is also comprehensively considered when: 
* Selecting furniture – schools prefer adjustable tables and chairs, 
* Building a digital environment in the classrooms and schools – especially considering the lighting of the rooms... protecting children’s sight, the way data projectors and IWBs are mounted, the weight of the notebooks, the size of the keyboards and the mice, preferring wireless mice, keyboards and headsets... because younger children often forget and walk off from the computer with their headsets on, breaking wires and frightening themselves. 
* Respecting health and safety issues – we make sure that children experience a wide range of different activities and spend the time in front of a computer efficiently. 

However, teachers are aware that it is difficult to meet all those requirements if... equipment and premises are shared by kids from 7 to 15 years old."

#### Highlights

* Whenever possible, try to use different representations of the same concept, different languages to express the same idea
* the variety of tasks, languages, materials and examples also play an important role for teachers to meet needs of all kids in one classroom
* differentiated, personalized learning for students with special needs
* more choice in how to learn and what tool to use for that and for express themselves


### 2.4 Digital content: Choosing and using

#### Choosing:

* previous experience and critial judgement of their teachers
* school leaders and ICT coordinators
* learners' needs and skills level
* cultural and religious beliefs
* ethical and moral values
* compatible with their pedagogy
* fitting into the national curricula (by the quality of the content and its appropriateness for a particular puropse)
* in some cases the content is selected centrally for the whole country or at a regional level
* the possibility to localize and adapt the content is of high importance
* additional audio-visual stimuli that will allow pupils to retain the information by engaging several senses (10)

#### Which kind of digital content they use?

* digital libraries
* multimedia resources (pictures, videos, animations, sounds, songs)
* educational applications (simulations, microworlds, sequencing programs, subject-specific apps, games, interactive microworlds for developing skills)
* textual documents
* presentations
* web pages
* activities for IWBs
* comics
* puzzles
* animated fonts for pupils' presentations
* web sites
* e-books
* audio books
* professional content for literacy, numeracy and science
* ets (10)
* general creative tools and enviornments: music editors, photo editors, text editors, (collaborative) story telling tools, brochures editors, writing practice tools, web blogging tools
* various content sharing tools and platforsm (11)

#### Highlights

* software should be interactive, should allow different actions, kids should be inspired to explore without having to give only correct answers

### 2.5 Digital content: Getting, buying, sharing, and developing

"The study shows that concerning the source of the content, four different models can be identified (and their combinations): 
* schools, school districts or school networks purchase or subscribe from different digital content vendors, 
* schools get general access to on-line libraries of digital resources provided by the government or regional/local educational authority, 
* teachers (or pupils) develop their own content (presentations, tests, flashcards, worksheets, texts, games, interactive programs – microworlds ... ) then share it with other teachers and other schools (some of them note that this is the only choice for them to have what they find appropriate for their pupils, some others say they do that because of the lack of financial resources), 
* teachers search for free Internet content (educational portals), sometimes configuring what they find to their own needs." (14)

#### Developing their own content

##### By teachers
"when preparing for their classes, teachers create new learning materials for learners, then they often post this into the school’s digital library or school LMS to distribute and share. Then they often share their product with other schools... /.../  Some teachers are involved in an initiative or a project focused on the development of the digital content sponsored by the government. Most of the teachers believe that such approach should be supported even more intensively. Some teachers also want to develop their own software applications. " (15)

##### By learners
"in some schools, pupils develop their own e-books, animations, videos, and presentations... and then publish them on the web."

The schools are significantly interested in **open content** and **open educational resources**. (15)

#### Highlights
* Hungary: "Future Informatics teachers and special education teacher students often develop educational applications especially for our needs in form of various course projects or master theses, which we then integrate into our teaching." (16)

### 2.6 Main challenges

* Financial issues
* Incompatibile hardware
* Quality issues
* Creativity issues
* Compatibility with curriculum
* time demands (it takes too much time to work through the large amount of content available to find the correct bits, often with rather superficial description)
* sensitvity and respect (cultural and religious issues)
* digital safety and security
* suitability of technology and content (digital content and ICT should be selected on the school, class and teachers' level, not anywhere else)
* accessibility for learnres (anytime, anywhere)
* the language of the digital content (limited options for others) (18)

### 2.7 Future plans

* Functionality of the school LMS: more powerful tools to support the management part of the process
* digital infrastructure: extending and upgrading wireless connection
* the spectrum of technologies
* availability of technology
* moving towards mobile learning
* attractive and stimulating learning material for pupils to support their learning
* digital libraries of multimedia resources
* developmentally appropriate, intuitive and comfortable versions of general software tools and editors
* developmentally appropriate tools to support and facilitate collaboration and communication
* tools for pupils to experiment, explore, manipulate
* tools for supporting teachers to teach, assess, organize, prepare their own content

### Short oservations and notes revealed by the study:
* costs and licences issues pose a serious problem to teachers in their everyday work, 
* many of them struggle with the lack of non-English digital content,
* if all pupils have tablets with effective access to high quality digital content, they would not have to carry the books and heavy school bags,
* some teachers call for permission for their pupils to use mobile phones in their classes in a productive educational ways (which however is not permitted in most of the schools),
* most teachers call for rich digital environment – with a scanner, a printer, digital microscopes and educational robots in each classroom,
* often the urgent need is highlighted to equip teachers themselves with powerful digital technology (which is not always the case),
* most of the schools go through similar ‘stages of priorities’: desktop computers – data projectors – notebooks – one to one rich digital environment – IWBs – digital content – LMS – tablets and mobile technology – complex, rich, flexible and omnipresent digital learning environment. Naturally, what some schools and teachers are planning or dreaming about, some other schools have already implemented it, all of it or some parts of it, emphasising and specialising in certain directions.

</figure>

## Computers, projectors, touch screens, interactive whiteboards ...

IWB's are intearactive only when they are applied by educators using an interactive pedagogy.

## Educational software

**Drill and practice software** - less appropriate in early childhood, but still frequently used. It is suggested that tehese should be used with caution as they promote a very directive form of teaching, normally with the use of an external reward and over-reliance on these kinds of program might lead to a reduction in children's intrinsic motivation to learn (Siraj-Blatchford and Whitebread 2003, 8). (57)

**Multi-purpose (generic) software** - much more potential than **dedicated (domain specific) software**. It provde tools that can be applied for a variety of purposes. At the same time, this software usually reflects a constructionistic developmental paradigm.

**Computer games**: children learn when solving, they use their knowledge, if they fail they change their strategies in order to get better results, they learn to analyze situations and find solutions; supervision of the teacher

## Digital and programmable toys - planning and controlling technology

"As stated by Siraj-Blatchford and Siraj-Blatchford (2006: 40), the well-designed on- screen applications help develop creativity by supporting a wide variety of possible inputs and responses of the children. programmable toys may provide still greater possibilities. Many of the benefits gained from older pupils using Logo will be paralleled by young children’s use of programmable toys. Problem-solving skills will be encouraged, and geometric concepts, collaboration, and higher-level thinking developed. In programming a toy to behave in a certain way, children have to see the problem from the toy’s perspective. They have to decentre, adopting a body- centred system of reference which Papert (1980) termed body syntonicity." (61)

## Web and e-mail

* študentski kotiček na spletni strani šole - povezave na zanimive, poučne, igrive spletne strani


## ICT as a tool for ...
PURPOSE!

ICT as a tool for:

* recording and communicating
* constructing
* observing and discovering
* role-playing etc. (63-64)

"The other engaging technologies are digital camera, digital video camera, imager, digital microscope and telescope, scanner, graphical tablet, telephone, walkie- talkie, voice and sound recorder, digital photo frame and talking photo album, players, ipods and amplifiers, musical keyboard, kinaesthetical music input (Soundbeam), printer, digital temperature, distance, light sensors, metal detector, construction robotic sets (LEGO WeDo, see Box 3.4 in Chapter 3), as well as the defunct and imitation technology used as role play tools. Some of them, name- ly digital cameras, scanners, printers and robotic sets, were frequently and expli- citly mentioned in most of the reports, while others were noted rarely or were not  mentioned at all." (64)

### Digital camera
The most frequently used tool. Students love it, they took photos, look at things differently as photographers, and show pictures to their parents. (65-66)

> From all the reports, we may conclude that the more the centre exploits ICT in its processes, the more teachers reflect about the related learning goals and benefits for children.

"They can start with computer, then gradually expand their equipment with other ICT categories like printer, scanner and digital camera, more and more often interactive whiteboard, programmable toys and robots, tools for recording sounds, etc. It also holds that the more the centre devotes to engaging ICT and extending its digital equipment, the more effort it invests into consistent integration of these technologies across the curriculum. They clearly express their belief that only  this way ICT will support their goals in the most productive way. Systematic integration also effectively prevents or minimizes many concerns, possible risks and dangers." (66)

# Ask an experienced teacher

# One-to-One: How much do we need?

"Some people advocate a One-to-One approach in education: that is, providing one device (for example, one tablet computer) for every student in the classroom, or in the whole school. The E-Learning Foundation in the UK is a charity that campaigns for bridging the gap - or the ‘digital divide’ - that separates children who have good computer access from those who have none."

## [One to One Tablets in Secondary Shools](http://elearningfoundation.publishpath.com/Websites/elearningfoundation/images/PDF%20Documents/Honeywood_2012_Barbie_Clark.pdf) report, 7-12

### Decision making

* Reasons for 1:1: "First was a wish to change pedagogy in terms of the way pupils learn and teachers teach. Second was a shared sense of the importance, for pupils, teachers and the school, to keep up to date with new technology and new and innovative digital devices. The third and perhaps most significant factor was recognition of the importance of providing each pupil with their own one-to-one device, and a shared belief that this would enhance learning and give equal opportunity to every child in the school."
* after consideration they choose ipads (7)

### Misgivings and the Process of Change

* There was some apprehension expressed by teachers and parents prior to adoption. A real 
concern was that pupils’ safety would be compromised and that pupils might be vulnerable 
to theft from transporting such a valuable and highly sought after device. There was also 
concern that pupils might lose and mislay the device. In fact neither of these concerns were 
realised in any of the schools. (7)
* Pupils were careful not to lose their device, and it was noticeable that each child in each 
school took great pride in it; they personalised the device by purchasing individual covers, 
and each had a personalised screen saver. This also helped to distinguish to whom each
device belonged, and so minimised loss. It should be noted that pupils were particularly 
delighted to receive iPads which were seen as ‘state-of-the-art’ and highly covetable. (7-8)
* Some teachers, perhaps understandably, were concerned that teaching with Tablets would 
challenge their teaching style, and would create a sense of chaos and disruption. This was 
helped greatly if teachers were able to familiarise themselves with the device before term 
started, and those teachers who had already purchased a device for their personal use were 
less apprehensive > they took ipads home to get familiar with it > the result: this process of familiarisation and discovery appeared to enhance teaching style and the ability to use the Tablet in an innovative and creative way; students were engaged and teachers learned from them on all aspects: apps, shortcuts, storage, information ... It was amazing how quickly students learnt (8)

### The process of integrating tablets in the schools

* shool leadership support is very important
* Initial challenges to schools included technology infrastructure. Each school had to ensure 
that there would be appropriate bandwidth to cope with the demands of several hundred 
Tablets accessing the internet at the same time, and had made considerable investment to 
meet this demand. 
* While teachers and parents had expressed concern about safety and potential theft of the 
devices, what had been overlooked was the fragility of the device and potential for 
breakages. Children invariably dropped the iPad and breakages were quite high (around 5-
7%). This breakage level decreased as children learnt to respect the fragility of the device, but 
continued to be a problem throughout the year. Each school was looking into the possibility 
of having a repair centre close at hand, possibly within the school. Schools were also 
considering issuing much stronger covers for the Tablet, which were more likely to protect 
the device. Insurance and repair, and covers are therefore important considerations. (9)

### The impact of the tablets - pupil-led learning and motivation to learn

* pupil-led learning
* increased pupil-teacher communication via e-mail
* work could be marked and returned soon after a lesson - learning was more immediate, pupils felt supported as individuals, with any misunderstanding of difficulties in schoolwork identified far sooner than before the use of tablets
* immediacy of marking, informed judgements about pupils' understanding and learning, it assisted in monitoring individual pupil's progress
* genuine excitement, increased motivation to learn
* pupils were more creative, independent, engaged with their schoolwork (9)

### Collaborative learning

* increased collaboration(9)
* kreativnost, inovativnost
* sharing ideas and apps
* For one school this was through the 
school intranet, another had a newsletter, and all had a common place where ‘App of the 
Week’ for each subject could be displayed. In all three schools pupils were contributing in 
positive ways to this process, often discovering suitable content or apps before teachers 
were aware of them. It was also common to all schools that teachers were beginning to 
develop their own apps. (10)

### What facilitated successful adoption of tablets into schools

* It is difficult to isolate the role of the brand (iPad) in the pupils’ response to the Tablets. 
While some parents felt the ‘iPad factor’ was bound to have an effect, teachers argued that 
the novelty for most pupils had worn off and that pupils were now engaging with the device 
as a learning resource. 
* t involving parents effectively in the planning stage, and providing training and 
information, are essential to ensure parental engagement and acceptance. While parents 
initially had misgivings about Tablets, it helped a great deal if they were given training and 
support, and reassurances about safety and security. An unexpected but welcome 
advantage of this process reported by schools was that parents not normally engaged in 
school activities were keen to attend meetings about the Tablet. The Tablet appeared to 
offer a connection between school and parents that had not previously existed. 
* Clearly teacher engagement was also essential, but it appeared that most teachers were 
enthusiastic about the new pedagogical model that one-to-one Tablet teaching offered, and 
as they began to understand the full potential of the Tablet through the year, their 
enthusiasm increased. (10)

### Satisfaction with the introduction and use of tablets in schools

* greater motivation and interest in schoolwork; they din not point to the specific brand as playing role in this. They expressed satisfaction and took pleasure in the interactive nature of Tablets, and the change in lesson and learning styles. 
* Pupils were motivated by having a variety of ways in which to learn and present their work, 
which was facilitated by the Tablet
* School leadership as well as teachers felt that as well as greater parental engagement, the 
introduction of Tablets had led to increased parental satisfaction with the school. Many 
parents were impressed with the direction the schools were taking, and as the devices were 
highly visible at home as well as in school most parents were aware of how they were used, 
and of their benefits
* Parents in focus groups expressed varying degrees of knowledge of, and confidence in, using 
technology, and this influenced their initial responses to the introduction of Tablets.

### Perceived Concerns about the introduction of one-to-one tablet learning

* parents: costs and securitay
* some parents: that children never "switched off". seems that parents should be encouraged by 
schools to impose limitations on their child’s Tablet use at home, for example, not taking 
them to their bedrooms at bedtime, and limiting the time spent online at home. 
* The lack of appropriate educational content was a challenge to teachers at the three 
schools, and the schools requested a larger investment by educational publishers and 
content providers in innovative and compelling interactive educational content. Several 
teachers across the three schools had begun to create their own content, such as interactive 
iBooks. (11)

### The Perceived Benefits of one-to one tablet learning

* personal, portable
* constantly access to school resources, communication, interaction with teachers and peers, entertainment (tudi tisti, ki so si morali prej doma deliti računalnik z drugimi)
* freedom of a personal device - they xould do research at any given time.
* teachers: not having to book resources in advance
* technology is perceived as giving pupils an advantage in their future academic studies or professional career
* Touch screen technology was seen as especially beneficial due to its size and weight, its 
portability, with an interface that was easy to understand as well as intuitive to use, as well 
as lowered cost compared to PCs.  (11)
* Pupils with special educational needs (SEN) were also experiencing the benefits of using the 
Tablet in their learning. Due to the simplicity and intuitive nature of the touch screen 
interface these children were able to access their learning in a variety of ways, as well as 
accessing applications commonly used with children with learning difficulties. Many also 
found the ability to communicate via e-mail helpful. Teachers reported that being able to 
use the same device as their peers led to feelings of pride and increased self-worth amongst 
these children. 

## Arguments for One-to-One (forum)

* Daniel Carr: If ICT tools are important for communication, collaborating, accessing knowledge / ideas and producing, then having a 1-1 device for students is essential.  It allows students to be 'at the ready' to be a participant in the larger discourse/discussion (whatever project this may encompass).   Not having a personal device at the ready would leave those students without one, at a disadvantage (and in excluded at some level) from the opportunities accessible by the students who do have a device of their own access.  
* trully integrate technology into our lessons, you don't need to go to ICT suite, you can start immediately, any time
* it frees teachers from the constraints of planning around technology (when available, if available ...) > instead, technology can be used around the goals for the lesson
* individualization
* Cibele: we can better adapt resouces to weaknesses or strenghts, useful for collaborative work
* more self-paced
* resources can be accessed at all times
* Sheona Smith: "I believe the main point in favour of using 1:1 tablets in schools is that it increases motivation and engagement amongst students.  This engagement with the tool is transforming how both children and teachers learn and is therefore helping to change and develop education and move it away from the industrialised approach of treating all students in the same way and expecting all young people to progress/learn at the same pace. In my opinión no other tool has been able to aid to such an extent in achieving  this switch to 21st century learning."
* Jacqueline Samuels: "The one-to-one approach gives students the freedom to explore given applications at their own pace. Students can be better engaged as they focus on their own development and mastery of the skill."
* greater flexibility
* Steve Harries: "1:1 technology is great for learning outside the school gate. If learners can 'own' a device they may engage their learning at anytime, particularly with competitive, gamified and social tasks.In school those same 1:1  individuals can pool the resources to complete collaborative work using shared cloud services - producing projects satisfying the social teamwork aspect of learning."
* Heather McCartin: "Arguments for a 1:1 ratio

  -1. Community and Communication - students can interact with one another via email, messaging, collaborating, and sharing on their devices.  Every student would have the same brand and type of device, providing consistency for students.

  -2. Pride - students have a precious object to take care of, be responsible for, watch out for, etc.  Students can be on the cutting edge of technology, using the same devices as their educators.  The pride can contribute to self-worth for the students.

  -3. Accessibility of information - students and educators can research at school or at home, with the Web at their fingertips, without needing to wait to check out a book, or bring home heavy texts."
* Nur Ali Tejani: "In my viewpoint there are several argument in favor of 1:1 access of tablets/laptop in the classroom. Such as
  -It increase student motivation and tablets in the classroom will get even the most shy students excited and more engaged. (I experienced this).
  -The world of educational app
  -Powerful communication and collaboration tool
  -Userfriendly with enhanced touch interfaced, easy to use 
  -Platform for e-learning"
* Maria: "1:1 provision is important in allowing all children equal access, at the same time."
* Bindu Grover: "Some of my views regarding BYOD:
  -Students help each other and work collaboratively to get set up on the different devices.  
  -They have firsthand experience on various operating systems
  -A healthy curiosity is developed about what devices are available, and what they can do (or not do!). 
  This would lead to meaningful discussions about what device they/school should buy or not- preparing them for life!"
* personalized
* Chung Sin Le: "I think one-to-one programme is personalised. For example, with every child in the class having an electronic device, I am able to conduct Formative Assessment electronically using Kahoot or Socrative Teacher. And, since students take ownership of the devices, I think I can also teach them to be independent in organising their study schedule, using the calendar function in the device. By taking ownership I can also teach them to budget their usage, Data Sense in Windows Phone is able to do so, which is a self-monitoring skill. All in, I guess there are more than listed here. Of course, parents could also link their phones to their children's if I anyone of you knows of any software that helps in the area, such as linking children's calendar activities to the parents' phones so that they always knows what is going on in school about their children, or the electronic newsletter sent electronically to parents' subscribed email addresses (similar to the reminders here in this course)."
* Linda Shuttleworth: "In an ideal world there would be resources for everyone. So I 'm an advocate of 1:1 - there are plenty of arguments above in its favour. This doesn't of course mean that a teacher should always use the equipment 1:1 - that should depend on the pedagogic justification."
* Hiba Sheikh: "Working in groups is very effective for students to learn; they discuss, share, investigate, etc... Yet, in other instances, and with the growing need for differentiated instructions and the variety of learning styles, students need to have their own device. In this case, they work according to their level and needs; which allows the learning process to develop properly and on a faster pace."

> For me, teaching a class with every student having his own tablet would be dreamy. They can use it for individual work or in pair/groups (and working in the cloud or sharing the output later). It's like each children having his own textbook and other things such pencils. To work on your own pace, according to your own learning style, to be as creative as possible, to learn whenever and wherever and however you want, you nedd your own device.
I'm a huge believer in e-portfolios and making them without student's each own device this is impossible. Having your own device you can make notes, take pictures, videos, edit and save everything. 
Having your own tablet is important for your ownership on the work you've done. You have everything on the same place/device and you can access it anytime you want.
Having your own tablet also means you can immediately get feedback -  from your teacher, from your peers ...
I think 1-1 is the future. 


## Arguments against One-to-One (forum)

* finances
* Steve Harries: " ICT brings curiosity, engagement and investigation, all activities best developed in a shared learning environment not in isolation with headphones.  Groups need to be very small though 1:2 1:3 to ensure inclusion."
* the quality of handwriting
* parent's concern that children "never swithced off"
* social skills
* devices will be outdated in few years
* health and safety of the children: Heather McCartin: "Health is the primary downside that I see.

  - Emotional heath - choosing the device over socializing with others (friends and family)
  - Physical heath - students may be less inclined to exercise, get up and move, preferring to sit with device
  - Intellectual Health - students are presented to a plethora of information online, much of which is not age/developmentally appropriate for them .  I know schools that use firewalls to protect students from unsafe sites, but there is always the opportunity for hacking, sites falling through the cracks."
* Jonathan Foster: "An issue that Larry Cuban has looked at on some depth is the idea that schools see the latest technology as the magic ingredient for education with a lack of real scientific proof that they actually add anything.  The investment that many schools have put into interactive whiteboards is huge yet the majority of classrooms I see they are simply used as projectors (which can be bought for a fraction of the cost).  Is this due to a lack of training or the fact that it was simply an expensive replacement for perfectly capable existing kit that did the same job sold to schools easily impressed by a salesperson?  My worry is that iPads will be the same and will result in lots of ICT cupboards filled with unloved technology when Apple no longer support them or they are usurped by another shiny toy."
* Maria: "do we run the risk of implementing a culture of "users" rather than creators of technology, by making it so easily accessible? Won't a 1:1 provision encourage lots of (granted) good use, but easily that? Should we not be in the market for encouraging creative thinking, innovative approaches, new content?"
* distraction: Chung SIn Le: "If students are not taught about self-discipline, self-monitoring and responsibility, essential soft skills of the 21st C, problems could happen, such as visiting undesirable websites, chatting none-stop online (the electronic version of passing notes in class), or filming the class in action for the wrong reason and sharing it."
* technical issues
* Roger R. Marcellus-Litvin: parents being critical of technology and advocating for "tried and true" methods
