# 1.2.1 What kind of learning is being elicted here?
I watched video of children using tablets when learning about butterflies. They were creative and made a movie. The teacher combined IT with methods such discussion, small group discussion, field trip. The IT is in the focus, but it's combined with other methods, and this help children to benefit more.

Positive words about children learning and creating with tablet computers: fun, engagement, learning, digital literacy.

Negative words about children learning and creating with tablet computers: time-consuming

*Idea to use*: Wordcloud: Children with one word express their opinion about something. There can be two word clouds: one for positive words and one for negative words. The answers could be given via Google Forms, Socrative ... At the end teacher (or one of the students) create a wordcloud. It can be also made for more classes, not just one, or at one word cloud for each class and one for all classes, so they can compare their opinions. Comparing wordclouds teacher can see the differences between classes and evaluate his teaching (he ask himself why there are differences).

# 1.2.2 Which aspects of technology use foster which types of learning?
We should be critical on the ways of using ICT in education, but also appreciative to innovations they are bringing. We should itegrate ICT as much as possible. I hope that one day the e-education is going to be so normal, that we could use it without the *e-*. :)

**In the 21st Century Primary Shool we should ask ourselves:

* why we should consider ICT at all?
* what does the ICT-enabled environment look like?
* where does the technology succeed and why does it sometimes fail?
* what can you do to make it work effectively?**

## Types of learning and Learning technologies video presentation
In the document there are shown different teaching methods and ways how we can improve them.
Digital technologies are good for different types of learning.

We shouldn't ask ourselves: "What can we use this technology for in teaching and learning?" but **"Here is the teaching/learning problem - how can technologies help?"** (othervise we are not solving the problem, we are just happy with what the technology is good for.) Asking this question helps to use technology in a good way - for helping in the most important issues at the teaching/learning.

Firstly we should ask ourselves: "How do the students learn?" And then: "How can technologies help?"

There are 6 types of learning (according to Diana Laurillard):

### Table: Definitions of Learning Types

| Learning type | The learning experience |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| Acquisition | **Learning through acquisition is what learners are doing when they are listening to a presentation or podcast, reading from books or websites, and watching demos or videos.**<br><br>This is probably still the most common type of learning in formal education. The student is playing a relatively passive role while the teacher uses the transmission mode of teaching… We cannot avoid learning through acquisition. Students need to learn what others have discovered, to hear about expert ways of thinking and practising, and what is known already about the subject. Enabling students to build on the work of others is fundamental to formal education and the progressive development of ideas. |
|----
| Discussion | **Learning through discussion requires the learner to express their ideas and questions, and to challenge and respond to the ideas and questions from the teacher, and/or from other students.**<br><br>The discussion may or may not end with a consensual outcome. The pedagogic value is the reciprocal critique of ideas, and how this leads to the development of a more elaborated conceptual understanding. |
|----
| Investigation | **Learning through investigation guides the learner to explore, compare and critique the texts, documents and resources that reflect the concepts and ideas being taught.**<br><br>Rather than having to ‘follow the storyline’, as in learning through acquisition, they are in control of the sequence of information, and can ‘follow their own line of inquiry’, making them more active, and giving them a greater sense of ownership of their learning, taking a critical and analytical approach, and thereby coming to a fuller understanding of the ideas. |
|----
| Practice | **Learning through practice enables the learner to adapt their actions to the task goal, and use the feedback to improve their next action. Feedback may come from self-reflection, from other students, from the teacher, or from the activity itself - if it shows them how to improve the result of their action in relation to the goal of the activity.**<br><br>This helps them to develop, understand and use the knowledge and skills of a discipline, like ‘learning by doing’, or ‘learning through experience’. |
|----
| Collaboration | **Learning through collaboration embraces mainly discussion, practice, and production. Building on investigations and acquisition it is about taking part in the process of knowledge building itself.**<br><br>It is distinct from learning through practice because although it builds something this is necessarily done through participation and negotiation with peers. It is distinct from learning through production, because although it produces something this is through debate and sharing with others. |
|----
| Production | **Learning through production is the way the teacher motivates the learner to consolidate what they have learned by expressing their current conceptual understanding and how they used it in practice.**<br><br>Producing an output generates a representation of the learning enabled by the other types. In its simplest form it is the learner’s expression of their current thinking, which enables the teacher to see how well they have learned, and to respond with feedback, guidance and further explanation.|

Definitions are taken from Chapters 6-11 in Laurillard, D. (2012). Teaching as a Design Science: Building Pedagogical Patterns for Learning and Technology. New York and London: Routledge.*

The best learning environment uses all learning types. "Children need to be able to learn through all these different types of learning, with the teacher, with therir peers, and on their own.Conventional methods provide good ways of all these different types of learning, but ICT can offer new opportunities and ways.

What we should be careful about:
* What can technology not do (for example: it doesn't know if you put the pictures in the movie in the right order) - for this you need the teacher
* time (students spend a lot of time learning about ICT and not about the science)

So the role of the teacher is crucial in making sure that the design of the lesson is appropriate and what the children learn is science. The technology can help, but the teacher has to be sure it helps. We shoul try to improve the quality of the lesson with ICT and not invent lessons with use of ICT. What is great about technology is that there is a variety of tools that we have that allow us to make things.

#### Should we use technology during collaboration and discussion parts of the lesson?
On the forum there was arguing about the use of the ICT during collaboration and discussion parts of the lesson. Here is the answer from our instructor, Diana Laurillard, whit which I agree:

> Good questions Daniel. You're right that the classroom is the ideal place to develop discussions and collaborations between students, orchestrated by the teacher.  No point in replacing that. But for collaboration activities, technology can be used to support a group producing something together, for example.
>  
>  For discussion, there are three reasons for using technology-based environment in primary education:
>  
>  * Many students find f2f communication difficult, and find it easier to express themselves in writing. They may be very comfortable in social media, and not all happy in f2f conversations. The online discussion is asynchronous usually, and you can take your time to react and compose your thoughts. But once having developed a little confidence in talking, arguing and debating and having their voice heard online, they are able to build on that to develop more confidence in class. This applies especially to teenagers, but for children who can write, the online discussion could help them into better f2f performance. This needs careful orchestration by the teacher of course.
>  * Classroom time is constrained, whereas asynchronous online time is not and children can continue their discussions or collaborations beyond the classroom in a secure online environment.
>  * Homework is usually done at home, and if children have access to the school network this can be a place to meet to discuss homework. The teacher can design homework tasks to be more social and collaborative. That enriches what they do and helps them develop independent learning in a different way.

Here is my opinion: 
In the times when almost everyone uses some kind of social media, it's important to learn to communicate and share ideas not only f2f, but also in online environment. Children **need to learn about safe and smart use of social and communication tools**. I must agree with Cibele - technology "can improve or facilitate the learning sometimes, but it does not substitute all the activities in most classrooms". It's up to teacher to decide when it's best to use f2f communication and when to extend it online. It's he/she who knows his/her students best and what he would like to achive. As Gabriela said before: "we should try to keep the balance between f2f and online work." Both environments are important.

Students are going to use social media. They normally don't know about **dangers** such privacy, cyber bullying ... They are not critical when they are using them. So they need to learn how this systems work. And they also need to learn **netiquette**.

As our instructor mentioned above, **for some students it's easier to communicate online**. If it's asynchronus, they have time to prepare. And they can also **use some pictures, links of the websites ... to support their arguments**. They can even **share documents or work on them together online** (for example on Google Docs). It's much easier than work on the paper.
When I was teaching, I used classroom discussion a lot. And never online. There were many reasons for that, but the main reason is that I was their teacher only for a really short period of time and I knew that another teacher wouldn't use online discussion tools even if I teach students how to use them. And I also didn't have time to teach them, it's true. :) It would be fun, but it would take too much time. It would be a complication. But in different situation I think I would use it regularly.

There are also **student response systems**. It's not a real discussion tool, but it helps students to express themselves - they can ask questions to the teacher or answer short surveys and show their opinions in that way. I think it's  impossible to have opinion on, for example, some book, from the whole classroom in just few seconds in the normal way. With SRS it takes few second, everyone express himself and there is also with graph showing results - a synthesis. And in this case students are anonymous. Sometimes they prefer to be. I think it's the best to use classroom discussion afterwars, if there is anyone who would like to share his opinion on the results or if he needs to say something aloud.

And there is also one important aspect of online communication tools - **the discussion can be saved, so they can take look at it later when/if they need**.

With videoconference tools (and others) they can **connect with other students from other schools in the same country or also from foreign countries**. That helps them to maybe improve their language skills, they meet diferent cultures, it is more motivating for them and also seem more important. They are better prepared for discussion. 

So, make it short: there are many positive aspect on using technology in communication and collaboration. It's up to teacher to (criticaly) decide what is the best way in every single situation. And it's also important to evaluate the decision afterwards.

**The technology brings an oppurtunity to extend discussion beyond the classroom.** It helps children to learn how to communicate online, which is now just or almost as important as learn how to communicate f2f.

I think that the teacher knows the best *how* (in which situation) or *if* to use technology. Technology can improve learning, but it can't replace the teacher. We should try to keep the balance between f2f and online work.

### Definitions of "Learning types" in terms of typical technology used

#### Acquisition

##### Conventional technology

"Reading books, papers;
Listening to teacher presentations face-to-face, lectures; 
Watching demonstrations, master classes." (Diana Laurillard)

##### Digital technology

"Reading multimedia resources, websites, digital documents and resources;
Listening to podcasts, webcasts; 
Watching animations, videos." (Diana Laurillard)

My ideas: 

* Slovenian language: e-textbooks, applications, webpages (Prešeren.net, Wikipedija), soruces from digital library (dLib), multimedia sources (interactive webages such as http://www.s-sers.mb.edus.si/gradiva/w3/slo8/000_mapa/index.html, VLE), listening to the podcasts (made from other students or by teachers or others (radio: Slovenci po svetu, they can listen to different Slovenian dialects), webcasts, animations, video (documentary, history, biographic movies), reading e-books (on Wikivir …), PowePoint, Webquest.
* History: e-textbooks and other e-learning material, applications, webpages (BBC History, WIkipedija, Zgodovinarka), primary sources from the digital Library (DLib), multimedia (in VLE), podcasts, webcasts, animations, video (documentary, historical, biographical), e-books, PowerPoint, virtual trips (Google Street View, Google Earth), Webquest.
We could use flipped learning.
* Music: http://www.freetech4teachers.com/2014/05/listen-compose-and-play-music-on-sfs.html#.U4pH3PmPmHC

#### Collaboration

##### Conventional technology

"Small group project, discussing other students’ outputs, creating a joint output."

##### Digital technology

"Small group project, using online forums, wikis, chat rooms, etc. for discussing other students’ outputs, creatng a joint digital output."

I think collaboration is very important part of the learning process. Students learn how to work in a team and they learn from each other. It's very imporant for the teacher to make a synthesis on the end. My ideas: 

* They can **connect with other schools from Slovenia and abroad** via online chat rooms, online conferences, wikis, Google Docs, forums … They can talk about their findings, ideas … and work together on the project. In slovenian classroom, when we learn about Slovenians living abroad (across the border in Austria, Italy on Hungary or in other countries), we can make a virtual conference and call them (if possible students of the same age). Before the conference they can work in groups, researching about this topic (history background - changing borders, language, education, culture ...) and prepare questions. After the conference they write some report in Google Docs (they can write it collaboratively) for school journal.
* They can write a **book** about for example Napoleon’s life, they can make a magazine/newspaper for some event or longer period of thime (Majniška deklaracija, the beginning of WW1, Paris Peace Conference. In Slovenian language lessons they can write a fairytale together or make a “lepljenka” poem.
* Together they work on their **spreadsheets**.
* They can make a PowerPoint/Prezi … **presentation** about some writer/poet, historical figure or an event … 
* During Slovenian language lessons they can make a **play or film** on the book they’re reading. 
* They can also make a virtual exhibition. 
* They can use Padlet as a digital bulletin board.
* Students can become **the curators** and make their own **virtual exhibition** on the certain topic. They can put it on the school's website or on their blog.
1. Teacher introduces the topic, for example Ljubljana in ww2.
2. When students learn about the background for the topic (ww2), they are told to look for interesting object for virtual exhibition on Ljubljana in ww2. They can make pictures, look for pictures on the web, find some material in the museum, search for primary resources in the digital library, ask their grandparents if they have any memory on ww2 ... For every single object they write down what it is, where did they find it, why it is important and some interesting fact about it (just the same as in the museum). They can work in pair or groups and each one has different topic (for example children in Ljubljana during the ww2, Italian occupational regime, German occupational regime, food, wire around the city ...).
3. They collect material online on Pinterest/flick/blog/Padlet ... With the picture they write down the supporting information for virtual visitors (classmates and the teacher).
4. Students visit the exhibition and comment on other students' work. They can invite other people, for example real curators, to visit their virtual exhibition.
* **Local history** (the medieval town of Škofja Loka, Slovenia):
1. After they learn about the medieval times, they use their knowledge on some example - local history. They get instructions from their teachers, the instructions are also published online so they can take look at them later. They are told to make guided tour around medieval city for their classmates, each group has one sight.
2. In groups they search for information about each sight (for example about the city hall, the castle, the walls, the river, the granary, the curch ...). After they collect information, they prepare their presentations for classmates and also some quiz on Google Forms. All the groups can put their tasks on the same Google Form or they can work seperatelly and make also QR-codes to access their quiz. Or they can write quiz on google doc and teacher print them and make worksheets (in case that they don't have mobile divices).
3. Now it's time to become real "turist guides". The class goes to the city and each group gives a presentation on their sight, others have to do the quiz, ask questions, write notes ...
4. On the end they make a tourist guide (an e-book) and publish it online.
* My idea for slovenan language classroom: **radio drama**: after reading/listening to radio drama, they record one of their own. Each student has some role in the play: mostly they are actors, some takes care of the music background, one is director ... They record the radio drama, listen to it, maybe try again, and publish it online.

* I also like the idea of Aysin Maras: “I can recommend a web site for writing stories. This is a site that children join wilt their schoolmates in order to write collaboratively a story that has been started by an author. Every chapter is written by many schools , one of them is chosen with the decision of all participants to continue the story. So every school has a chance to contribute one or more chapter of the story. And finally the book is sold. This is a wonderful example of collaboration that would motivate, challenge the children The site is www.boomwriter.com”
They can write stories also on the Storybird page or they can create comics.

* Another brilliant idea is from Anthippi Harou:  “google docs. Children can work collaboratively and enhance their writing skills. They can write a joint story, for example, and then edit it in an easy way compared to that of the traditional and difficult paper and pencil mode. Students don't need to have any passwords to access the google doc and can work on it anytime they wish even after school. For my situation, it has proved to be the most accessible way of collaborative writing.”


#### Discussion

##### Conventional technology

"Tutorials, tutor groups, student seminars (students leading discussion), discussion groups, class discussions."

###### Digital technology

"Online tutorials, tutor groups and seminars, email discussions, discussion forums, web-conferencing tools (synchronous and asynchronous)."
My ideas
* Slovenian Language: forum (in VLE), wiki discussion pages, blog, YouTube, e-mail, chatroom, online conference (between students and teacher or with writers and other people).
* History: on the forum (in VLE), wiki, blog, YouTUbe, e-mail. Online conference (with historian, arcehologist, custodian, older people with interesting stories …).

#### Investigation

###### Conventional technology

"Using text-based study guides;
Analysing the ideas and information in a range of materials and resources;
Using books, people, field trips, to collect data for analysis;
Comparing texts, searching and evaluating information and ideas."

##### Digital technology

"Using online advice and guidance;
Analysing the ideas and information in a range of digital resources; 
Using digital tools to collect and analyse data;
Comparing digital texts, using digital tools for searching and evaluating information and ideas."
My ideas: 
* Students have instructions for work online. They can also get help online (extra instruction, hints, contact via e-mail/on forum/online chat).
* They can search for ideas and information, historical sources or literature on the web and analyse and evaluate them.
* For collecting and analysing data: Word/Google Doc, the cloud, VLE, Padlet, Pinterest …
Webquest.

#### Practice

##### Conventional technology

"Doing practice exercises; using tools; doing practice-based projects, labs, field trips, face-to-face role-play activities."

##### Digital technology

"Using digital tools, models, simulations, digital games, microworlds, virtual labs and field trips, online role-play activities."

My ideas: Digital tools, interactive quizes (Google Forms), simulations, virtual worls, virtual trips and exhibitions, online role play. 

* Ideas from others:
An idea from Maria Laura Scasso: "With students in grade 6, I would prepare a blog using blogger and recreate life in Ancient Rome. They would be in charge of preparing one post according to their topics. For example, one group prepares posts about daily life in ancient Rome and the others have to post comments as if they were Romans. They would include pictures and references where to find more information about what they are posting."

From Heather McCartin: "For an elementary grade unit on Oregon Trail, students can take turns playing the Oregon Trail simulation game, and record what they see, what happens to them, in their class journals. Students could then share their experiences with the class."

#### Production

##### Conventional technology

"Producing their own representations of what they have learned, using statements, essays, reports, accounts, designs, performances, artefacts, animations, models, videos."

##### Digital technology

"Producing and storing digital documents, representations of designs, performances, artefacts, animations, models, resources, slideshows, photos, videos, blogs, e-portfolios."

My ideas: 

* e-portfolio, 
* comics, 
* animation, 
* presentation (PowerPoint, Glogster), 
* production of digital documents (newspaper, book, article), video of their presentation, 
* they can make a virtual exhibition, they can collect historical sources on certain topic, literature (in a digital library), 
* they can make a movie (documentary, historical … - with the iPad they can record it and also edit it), publish their photos (for local history …), 
* they can write a post for a blog. 
* They can also write and publish e-book. They can make a newspaper/magazine on some topic/time period. 
* They can wrote and record a poem/music (for example on historical figure). They can write an essay and peer review it.
* I also wrote few ideas in Learning through collaboration, so here I'm writing just the results of the activities (products): virtual exhibition, tourist guide, radio drama.
* For us, visual types, there is [an interesting infographic: Show what you know using web and mobile apps](http://learninginhand.com/blog/show-what-you-know-using-web-mobile-apps-infographic.html).
You must be carefull that this part of the lesson (the usage of ICT) is not too time consuming – the most important is what do the students learn and not what they do with the technology.

The ideas from others:

* This idea is from Tatiana Bastiaanse: “Wordclouds – to activate words they already know about the subject we are going to tackle next.” > for this activity you can use Wordle
* The idea from Faye Nicole Ellis: “Ancienty Egypt: short animations to show what they knew about the different stages of the mummification process.”
The idea from Anonymous: “The page of a historical character (Glogster, Fakebook).”
This idea is from Suzanne Humphry: “Reading from child safe websites, find out about Henry VIII, his six wives and children. Use the researched information to create a simple family tree. Show children a simple family tree of the current Royal family tree using publisher banner. Can use class library books too.”
* Idea from Elaine Le Sueur: “For a study of ancient Egypt my students imagined that they were teleported back in history and wrote their own script for a short film that showed the different aspects of daily life that each was interested in. They researched and shared information with each other and then filmed the whole thing to show their parents.”

# 1.2.5 The range of ICT context for ICT in primary education
"The material in this course is based on the experiences of teachers and schools in different parts of the world, gathered as part of a UNESCO project to help us understand how ICT is being used in primary education. The project selected 20 primary schools that were using ICT well, in 12 different countries. Members of the course team visited the schools, and sent each one an extensive survey to complete, and shared the analysis across the team. The findings are being published in a UNESCO book. We will use chapters from the book throughout the course."

I've read the [**Chapter 1: Setting the Context from the UNESCO Book ICT in Primary Education. Volume 1: Policy, Practices and Recommendations**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/ictinprimary/unesco_book/Chapter_1_Setting_the_Context.pdf).
*ICT in Primary Education. Analitical survey. Volume 2. Policy, Practices, and Recommendations.* 

*Extract from Kalaš, I., Laval, E., Laurillard, D., Lim, C.P., Meyer, F., Musgrave, S., Senteni, 
A., Tokareva, N., Turcsányi-Szabó, M. (2014). ICT in Primary Education: Volume 2 Policy, 
Practices, and Recommendations. Moscow, Russian Federation: UNESCO Institute for 
Information Technologies in Education. Available online: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/ictinprimary/unesco_book/Chapter_1_Setting_the_Context.pdf. 1. 6. 2014.*

The chapter summarizes the responses to the UNESCO's survey about:

* the types of schools represented (large, small, urban, rural),
* the jorneys they have taken from the early days of using ICT,
* their reasons for doing it,
* the lessons they learned in the process. 

## 1.1 Overview
This chapter summarises the schools' responses on the questionnaire. It asks about »how ICT came to be integrated into the school, its origins, the process of development over the years, an the lessons they feel they have learned from their experience.« (stran 2) It also asked about the management and organisation of ICT in the school.

## 1.2 Why should primary schools use ICT?
All the schools responded that ICT should be used in primary education, mostly »for the sake of children's education«. (2)

There are many reasons why scools started using ICT: government, principals, teachers, parents, society … The reasons are external (f. e. governtment), internal (f. e. staff), educational (the potential of ICT).  (3)

Highlights: One of the schools from the UK said: »We are equipping children for a society where technology is insreasingly prevalent. Our children are using various forms of technology at home and it is important that they understand their use and are safe when doing so.« (4)

## 1.3 The 21st century school environment
(to be aware of the technological sophistication of the modern primary school)
»The innovative use of technology enables teachers to implement a rich and rigorous academic curriculum focusing on meeting students' individual social, emotional, and learning needs. Students are engaged and challenging learning empowered by interactive and mobile technologies inspiring higher order thinking, creativity, communication and collaboration, and solving real worls problems.« (5)

Types of IT proviesion that are common:

* IT infrastructure: server, IT for amanagement and administration, email and diaries are shared across all staff, high speed internet access, wifi
* ICT for teaching and learning: hardware (interactive whiteboards, desktop PCs, visualisers, digital audio and video equipment, Easi-speak michrophones, iPads, iPod Touch devices, MacBooks, tablets), educational software (3D-animations, films, virtaul experiments, digital educational games), IT inforastructure for teaching and learning (VLE or LMS)
* Access for students: one-to-one provosion (at least some classrooms), most classrooms have computrer access, rooms with computers for students to access for independent learning and project work, many students have computers at home for study (before- and afterschool clubs for those without access), motivating families to provide home access (task with ICT for homework), Learning Resource Centre, BYOD (5–6)

##1.4 Support for teachers
*How schools set out to support their teachers in the process of innovationg with learning* technologies (motivating, technical support, sharing technology, access to ICT after school hours)
* personal access: All teachers need to use computers after school. (11)
* A collaborative environment for working together: leadership is important for creating the culture of collaboration (12)
* pedagogic support: teachers will always need help with exploring new forms of pedagogy, because technology innovations will continue to produce a wide variety opportunities for improving teaching and learning.« (13)
* sharing new ideas, learning: new ideas are intrudced throug staff who are already confident or enthisiastic, worshops, conferences
* technical advice and guidance: »the continual advances in technology innovation mean that teachers are unable to keep up with all the latest opportunities for enhancing student learning – it's vital that someone in the school has responsibility for the supporting not just today's technology, but preparing for tomorrow's as well, and helping the teachers to do the same.« (13)
* well-trained technical support team (support staff, ensure that everythnig works, dicsucc technical support with teachers, develop a technology integration professional development plan, the instructional technology coach should plan and implement the multitude of professional development sessions to move towards ubiqutous technology integration) (13–14)

##1.5 The lessons learneg
*To be able to apply the lessons learned in others schools in the use of ICT*

What did the schools learned, what would they do differently:

**Leadership issues:**

* Recruitment: aim to attract teachers who can work with learning technologies
* Learn from other schools
* Unlock sites like YouTube, Facebook, Google
* Put ICT devices in the library and access halls – it's important for everyone to see the children working on computers (17)
* Give a greater role to ICT in development and assessment (motivating for learners, immediate feedback)
* Provide more mobile devices with wifi (cheaper, more flexibile use of ICT) (17)

**Lessons learned about what teachers need:**

* 1:1 access for teachers and students asap
* Much more attention
* Technology training sessions for staff members, professional development
* Pedagogic innovation
* Give teaching staff: good conditions for their work, open, public aknowledgement of their activities, a special financial bonus, opportunities to take part in conferences (18)


##1.6 Concluding points
ICT: creative, fun, engaging, collaboration, learning, interactive, creativity, authentic, motivating, exciting (19)

### What would help teachers to innovate?

In the forum there was the debate what would help teachers the most:

* Alexa Joyce: Teacher should have 10 % of their time for personal innovation project
* Someone else: The best way to integrate ICT to schools is to give teachers extra time to do their best
* Manisha: Another point that I think contributes to the lack of time given, is as Diana drew upon in the lecture, ICT not being top of the government agenda and therefore not being the immediate aim for schools. Schools have many pressures, most of which are to do with raising standards and strong results. I do think ICT can really help in this way however it does take time to be truly embedded as a culture in schools and therefore can be left on the back burner as it can take up a lot of time and resources. 
* Diana Laurillard: it's a systemic issue, and you can't fix it by any single change. The recognition that teachers need more time to innovate has been the conclusion of every report and study of ICT in schools that I have ever come across. It's there as well in the EU Schoolnet survey that's discussed in the 1.3.3 video. The teachers across all countries have equipped themselves with digital skills, but there is huge variation in how much the schools build on that to train them to use those skills. It's up to headteachers and policymakers to change that.

# 1.2.6 Why do schools choose to use ICT?
Look at the UNESCO's study (above /1.2.5).

What are the main reasons for thinking ICT should or should not be used in primary education? My opinion:

Why it should:

1. Internal
   1. motivation
   2. students' activity
   3. solving real world's problems
   4. better results
   5. better communication (extended opportunities)
