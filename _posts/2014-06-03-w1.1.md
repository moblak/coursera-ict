# Activity 1.1.1 What is the focus for this week?
Here we start with the week one, which sets the context for the course. There are four main chapters:

* Orientation to the week (in this post)
* Why we should consider using ICT in primary schools?
* The 21st Century School environment (what does it look like?, why does the technology sometimes succeed and sometimes fail?)
* Supporting teachers' needs
* Relecting on the lessons learned

We'll learn about some of the findings from the UNESCO IITE research.

Notes:

* This course is built around two books the team developed with the UNESCO IITE and it is meant to be a way of enabling the community of teachers to learn from each other.
* We'll learn: what's going on in some classrooms, many different ways in which ICT can be used, different kinds of tools and resources
* This knowledge is changing all the time because technology is changing all the time. Teachers are constantly discovering new ways of using technology.



Below is just about everything you'll need to style in the theme. Check the source code to see the many embedded elements within paragraphs.

# Activity 1.1.2 Preparing for getting somethin useful out of the course

# Activity 1.1.3 Sharing ideas and resources
We'll learn from each other. The [Scoop-it site is a collection of "Emerging Technology Enhanced Learning tools](http://www.scoop.it/t/etel) and we could also use [Diigo](https://groups.diigo.com/group/ict-in-primary-education)
