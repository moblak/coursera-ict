# 3.4.1 How do learners perceive learning?

Teachers must find the modes of assessment (choosing proper tools and methodologies) that provide personalised learning, by taking account of the range of differences and choices for assemssment methods.

## How Youth Learn

If I wanted to learn
1. I feel OK (no worries, distractions ...)
2. It matters (means something) (connected to real world; makes me care; teacher let me pick my assignement; you're a great teacher)
3. It's active (to own the information)
4. It stretches me (takes to a new level); the brain releases dopamine (a natural hugh when we learn)
5. I have a coach (access to help, guided practice, enough time, mistakes are part of the process)
6. I have to use it ("use it or lose it") (recall it, wrestle with it, teach it, perform it)
7. i think back on it (what did I learn, what would I change, how did I grow)
8. I plan my next steps (I build on it)

# 3.4.2 Recignising informal learning

School has created space for children to share their out of school experiences and to get formal credits for them. (GOOD IDEA!)

E-portfolio has an obtion to share with school, individual teacher, parents ... (he chooses with whom he would like to share)

The learning that takes place in an informal way: making skateboards.

I think I got an epiphany watching that video. :) I hope that one day the formal and informal learning will blend. Why wouldn't we credit students achievements outside the school? In our school we normally do give a mark (5/A) if someone is very successful in something (chemistry, history ...) on national level at some subject (but it's the teacher who decides about it, it's his good will), but there is not such school policy who would stimulate students in their informal learning and giving them credits for it.

Answer from the forum by Laura Scasso: "Yes, how could one not agree? The problem is that all this is more difficult to plan, organize and assess. What I have seen being used and which I think is a good start is 'genius hour project'. Teachers decide on a day when children are free to choose what they want to work on and they are monitored by the teacher but they work on their own projects according to their interests. They are free to use the tools they choose and to prepare the project they want.  It's not bad idea to start this new trend fit for our XXI century students."


*Search for assessment rubrics that would suit your Learning Object that you have built so far. Or you could use some of the ideas you find there to Create one that would be suitable for it.*

*Record your rubric and reason you chose it in your Course Journal.*
