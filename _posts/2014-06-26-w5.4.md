## Equal chances for everybody

*Read the description of the critical factors that support or hidden access to education for everyone in the short [Chapter 5 “Equal chances for everybody”](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/ictinprimary/unesco_book/Chapter_5_Equal_chances_for_everybody.pdf)  from Kalaš, I., Laval, E., Laurillard, D., Lim, C.P., Meyer, F., Musgrave, S., Senteni, A., Tokareva, N., Turcsányi-Szabó, M.

## Inclusive Education in Action

*On this web site you will find examples of policies, accounts of practice, stories, videos and more. All of these materials exemplify the suggested actions in the UNESCO Policy Guidelines on Inclusion in Education and show how people all over the world are working to strengthen the focus on inclusion in education which is recognised as a basic human right and the foundation for a more just and equal society. The Policy Guidelines stress that everyone can play a part: ‘Every initiative and action that stimulates more inclusive education systems is valuable and may play an important turning point in support of its further development.’*

### [UNESCO policy guidelines on inclusion in education](http://www.inclusive-education-in-action.org/iea/index.php?menuid=47)

[These guidelines](http://www.inclusive-education-in-action.org/iea/index.php?menuid=47) were discussed at the [International Conference on Education in Geneva in November 2008](http://www.ibe.unesco.org/en/ice/48th-ice-2008.html). The objectives of the guidelines are to assist countries in strengthening the focus on inclusion in their strategies and plans for education, to introduce the broadened concept of inclusive education and to highlight the areas that need particular attention to promote inclusive education and strengthen policy development.

## Perceptions (forum)

Mary S. Speed: "As information technology becomes increasingly more accessible in daily life, we become more aware of its potential for learners who are at risk of being excluded. For some pupils, using specific pieces of technology within a classroom situation can enable them to access the same curriculum as their peers. Support for educational inclusion can include:

* Individual attention: in areas such as reinforcement of understanding it can provide structure and variety.
* Spell-checker: as a support for young people with dyslexia but also inclusive tool to encourage the production of writing. 
*  Text-to-speech: supporting a wide range of text disabled young people both through computer based systems and low tech devices such as digital dictation devices. 
* Training specific skills: Understanding built into the software which modifies the pace and complexity of tasks presented to the student. 
* Planning tools: visual organizing or mapping to to support the structuring of 
information."
