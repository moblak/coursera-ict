* 9/06/2014 3:57:33 **ICT Integration in Primary Education and Teacher Education Programs in Turkey and  in EU Countries**:  I just read an article on ICT integration in Primary Education comparing EU and Turkey. Turkey lacks any initiative in regards to ICT compared to that in Europe and especially the UK. The Uk adopts a holistic approach to using ICT and embedded it into their laws. The UK has possibly gone the furthest in developing statutory orders for including ICT in the national curriculum across all subjects and for all K-12 levels.  http://egitimvebilim.ted.org.tr/index.php/EB/article/viewFile/831/182 Turkey  Sarah Bigg
