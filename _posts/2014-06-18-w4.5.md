# Questions to an experienced teacher

# Future plans

*Read [Section 2.7 Future Plans of ICT in Primary Education Vol 2, Ch 2: Technology opportunities](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/ictinprimary/unesco_book/Chapter_2_Technology_opportunities.pdf), which summarizes the responses to our survey about teachers’ plans and envisioned needs in the context of further extending their digital environment for teaching and learning.*

## Tools

* **Functionality of the school LMS**: more powerful tools to support the management part of the process; to better support pupils, improwing assessment system
* **Digital infrastructure**: extending and upgrading wireless connection
* **The spectrum of technologies**
* **Availabitilty of technology**
* **Moving towards mobile learning** (22)

## Digital content

* **attractive and stimulating** learning material for pupils to support their learning
* recognizing and respecting **individual diferences and needs** (for talented pupils, for SEN pupils, supporting different learning styles)
* brainteasers, puzzles, crosswords, anagrams, interactive excersises, topic based materials
* **digital textbooks** (option to annotate, use interactively, at any place) integrated with printed material
* to save time of the teachers, helping them to prepare better for lessons
* content that could be easily delivered to pupils via school LMS
* many techers would appreciate **digital libraries of multimedia resources** (pictures, sounds, videos, presentations), **online access to encyclopaedia, resources of good quality which will comprise materials to be used also on IWB.
* **developmentally appropriate, intuitive and comfortable versions of general software tools and editors** (22)
* **developmentally appropriate** tools to support and facilitate **collaboration and communication**, to conduct their own research and develop sustainable aqareness, to facilitate better online networking between pupils and their teachers (so that they could aks questions, submit assignments, polls, blogs) (22-23)
* Specific **interactive software tools for pupils to experiment, explore, manipulate**, and discover new “bits of knowledge” easily and intuitively
* (free) **tools supporting teachers to teach, assess, organize, and prepare** (develop, build, create) their own content with... map editor, game creator, media and movie editor etc.

## Observations and notes

*  costs and licences issues pose a serious problem to teachers in their everyday work,
*  lack of non-English digital content, 
*  if all pupils have tablets with effective access to high quality digital content, they would not have to carry the books and heavy school bags,
*  some teachers call for permission for their pupils to use mobile phones in their classes in a productive educational ways 
*  most teachers call for rich digital environment – with a scanner, a printer, digital microscopes and educational robots in each classroom, 
*  equip teachers themselves with powerful digital technology, 
*  most of the schools go through similar ‘stages of priorities’: desktop computers – data projectors – notebooks – one to one rich digital environment – IWBs – digital content – LMS – tablets and mobile technology – complex, rich, flexible and omnipresent digital learning environment.

# My technology decision

4.1.2 Q3: *What are your plans for further extending the digital environment of your school? Or what should a school be aiming for?*

*You are the person who has to make the investment decision for further developing the digital environment in a primary school. You are working within a limited budget so you will have to choose one technology item (have clear priority) for next school year, argue why the school should invest in this, and why it should be a higher priority than other alternatives. Even if you are not related to a primary school, answer the question assuming that position.  This does not have to be a formal "investment proposal", and you will not be judged by technical or economical criteria, we mainly want you to share your reasoning for why some type of technology might be important for a school setting.*

Technology: Android tablets (10 " preferably) One-to-One 

Why: high resolution and performance, long battery life, light-weight, price, android is more popular in Slovenia than iOS; we can use the same applications on other devices 

New learning opportunities
* online communication
* access to resources anywhere/anytime
* use of student response system, camera, apps, voice recorder ...
* self-paced learning

Improved learning opportunities
* resources are interactive and available anywhere anytime
* more interesting, variable tasks
* individualization, differentiation
* 21st-century skills
* variety of resources and content delivery (text, audio, video, games ...)
* immediate and more feedback (from teachers, peers, automatic)
* easier use of students' e-portfolios - they can edit them (add pictures, videos, notes) anytime anywhere, and immediately
* students can make notes already on presentations, they don't have to rewrite sentences to their notebooks (less time spent on lecturing)

Student motivation for learning
Increase: fun, interesting tasks and apps, individualization, creativity, ownership ...

Special needs
More individualizaton (font, audio-text, re-reading/re-viewing ...), differentiation

Facilitating the teachers work
* creativity,
* teaching and learning digital literacy
* teacher can pass the information on various ways
* grading and assessing: easier and less time-consuming, immediate feedback helps students to improve their work
* ICT can be used in any part of the lesson, no booking the ICT suite or ICT devices, there is no time spent on students starting the devices and log-in.
* students have always everything with them.

Better management & communication practices
Communication is extended online, students can get information anytime from the teacher and classmates, or teacher can give the information anytime (to remind students ...). 
Management is easier, less work, everything is online.

Why a priority?
Children should have their own device to work on to trully integrate ICT into teaching and learning. Tablets are affordable and the most portable devices, offer other tools such cameras, students voting systems ... Instead of paper textbooks digital content can be used. The use is intuitive and interactive. No other tool offers so many possibilites to use and offer such creativity. Using tablets students develop 21st C skills (collaboration, digital literacy, creativity).

# 4.5.5 Final reflection

During this week we have looked at different categories of ICT and pondered on what to consider when planning how to extend our digital equipment. An interesting points to think about are:

* How much technology we need: do we intend to reach One-to-One provision? 
* Do we plan to extend educational robotics equipment? 
* Do we make use of any programmable digital toys? 
* What kind of digital content do we use or plan to? 
* How should it be delivered to our students?
